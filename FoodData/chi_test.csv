Looks good!,1
Recipe?,1
looks sooo delicious.  No roasted suckling pig?,1
"Hahahaha, but I really really love spicy foods!!!",1
"Thanks, it‚Äôs also very spicy... if I opened my own restaurant this would be called ‚Äúthe face melter‚Äù on the menu.",1
It does.,1
The tummy craves what it craves.,1
It looks very appetizing.,1
Looks delish üëå,1
"Homegirl's internal monologue: Hmm.... needs more garlic chili sauce...maybe a bit more....aaaaaand one more time. 


Love it!",1
Looks good,1
Thanks for that great info!,1
Âú£ËØûÔºårather hahaha,1
I am going to try this soon. Im an American who was blessed to live in China for 5 months in 2010-2011. I failed to keep up with the language and culture but am recently getting back into it. Any tips so far? Âπ≤ÊùØÔºåÁîüÂΩìË°óÂø´‰πê!!!,1
Yummy yummy,1
Please quit spamming this subreddit if it has nothing to do with Chinese Food. I will downvote you every time (unless your post is specific to Chinese food).,1
More like a zi char restaurant tbh,1
"Yeah, I suppose you can ask that question about anything lol. I've just never really considered the flavour of the wrappers as very important (texture maybe more so), but maybe that's where I'm wrong!",1
"Just wanted to say that tough texture is usually a sign of the flour being high in gluten rather than low in gluten. Thats why if a cake recipe calls for cake flour (low in gluten), and you use AP flour or bread flour (both higher in gluten), it produces a denser and tougher texture. I know ramen noodle recipes will ask for added gluten, but that's intended to make noodle dough tougher and denser, and produce chewier noodles. In my experience, unless you specifically buy high gluten asian flours, Asian AP flours typically are lower in gluten content than King Arthur's AP (but also KAF's AP is known to be high in gluten -- in fact, it has more gluten than many other american bread bread flours)

But regardless, I do think asian flours result in superior dumpling wrap texture. I just rarely buy them because I mostly bake sourdough bread, so I have a ton of american flours (100+ lbs lol)",1
"Ah yes, the ever present‚Äùis it worth the hassle‚Äù dilema.  First of all there are many ready made frozen dumpling available so that‚Äôs the easiest option.  Also you have to subtract the value of doing something for the challenge and enjoyments.  Store bought wrappers are thinner than the hand rolled ones and the flavor and texture are different.  Hand rolled ones are more chewy.  Also you can make them as big or small as you want!

Honestly the main reason I learned is because I don‚Äôt keep wrappers on hand but I always have flour, water, and salt so I can feasibly whip up a batch if I get the craving or if the family wants some.",1
"I figure that it‚Äôs related to the low gluten content of barley vs wheat.  I‚Äôm glad that you have experience good success with King Arthur, that‚Äôs what I started using but my noodles/dumplings just wouldn‚Äôt behave correctly and the texture after cooking was very tough.  I read that you can supplement KA flour with extra gluten to remedy this problem.",1
"I think homemade wraps taste significantly better and they don't have additives and dough conditioners that store sold wraps and dumplings mignt have. Once you get good at it, you can make them very quickly. I make dumplings from scratch for weekday lunch sometimes (but I do work from home). The dough and wraps take less than an hour and half to make -- most of the time is spent waiting for the dough to relax before you roll and wrap them.",1
"Do you know why the added malted barley might be a problem? I ask because I use american flours that all have malted barley (king arthur for example), but I have not had any issue with making noodles or dumplings with them. And I generally do 50% hydration like you do for dumpling wraps.",1
"Cool, thanks. You had it in a restaurant or hawker? I miss Singapore hokkien mee!",1
"I just think they let it fry for a while on both sides until it gets charred :D
Don't think it's deep fried though heh",1
"How big a difference does it make to make your own wrappers, in your opinion? Is it worth the hassle? I always use store bought",1
"Wow, I love har cheong gai but I've never had this crispy beehoon. It looks amazing. Is it stir fried like normal beehoon first and then you allow it to crisp up on some parts? Or is it fully deep fried first and the stir fried?",1
thank you for the enlightenment haha,1
Is this delicious?,1
"Wow, looks delicious!!!",1
looks great!,1
I saw those chefs twist the noodles before they pull... So maybe u can try and it won't break so easily,1
it is Lanzhou beef noodle shop,1
it is red bean paste flavor,1
"Tell me about it, my goal is to become comfortable enough doing it so that when my kid wants them it doesn‚Äôt have to be a chore to make them, oh well I guess I have to make and eat a ton of dumplings!",1
Aw noice!!,1
"Also I should mention flour type is important, I buy a Korean brand all purpose from my Lola‚Äôs market that is 100% wheat.  Some othe brands have malted Barley and other things, this detail alone led to many failed noodles and dumplings.  Cheers!",1
"200 g flour
100 g water
1/4 tsp salt

Disssolve salt in water, slowly mix into to flour with chopsticks.  Need until it comes together, wrap and rest 20 min, knead again until smooth, wrap and rest 1 hour.  Roll out and divide into small balls!  

Tips:  keep the wrapper well floured after rolling.  I always lightly roll the ball into a fat disk before rolling out using the proper technique, helps to get a uniform circle.  It‚Äôs ok if they seem a little small, you can stretch them during the wrapping process.",1
Subscribed! Thank you kindly!,1
Preach,1
"I was taken aback by the mashed potatoes and gravy, and then realized that made total sense.",1
"Best part of thanksgiving is actually the turkey congee the next day, made by simmering the carcass and fat drippings on the stove overnight ü§§",1
"Why yes: [video walk-thru](https://youtu.be/ZfoU4z768g8)
You‚Äôll need: leftover turkey bones, water, rice, scallions, canola oil, salt, and time.",1
Bad? I reckon you're pretty good! It's just easy to get demoralised watching dumpling shop ladies bust out a wrapper per second haha,1
"Thank you!
I just used normal all purpose flour :)",1
Oh damn! Looks delish! Recipe?,1
Excellent and you've got a ton of patience! Regular bleached flour or does it have to be a specific pasta flour?,1
Super impressive that you made it from scratch!,1
"ahh ok thanks, it looks really good that I thought it was bought from a store",1
I'm super jealous! No pan fried turnip cake?,1

"It‚Äôs flour, salt and water. The dough is rested and then rolled out and coated in a lot of oil. It rests for 2 more hours and then is ready to be hand pulled.",1
Tim Ho Wan is amazing! Sadly there are none in my entire region.,1
What are ingredients in this dough?,1
"I ate the WanTan in restaurant , Tim Ho Wan",1

Did you eat this somewhere or do you have awesome serving ware at home?,1
In the netherlands its also wantan,1
"Hop up out my car

"Probably a British variant. Oxford English Dictionary‚Äôs examples show in 1976, an article in Times of London mentioned ‚ÄúWan Tan‚Äù while an article in Time magazine mentioned ‚Äúwontons‚Äù:

1976   Times 20 Aug. 12/8   Two spring rolls for 25p, skins for Wan Tan dumpling at 60p a lb.

1976   Time 27 Sept. 63/2   The Chinese deep-fry everything from shrimp toast and wontons to beef and chicken.

And our gracious original poster appears to be living in Singapore.",1

I know that wantan is an accepted alternative spelling for wonton... but where in the world is wantan used?,1
Go for itüòÉüòÉ,1
Actually gonna make this for dinner tonight.,1
Ohhh goodness. It's been too long since I've had prawn noodles and I've never had them with such huge ones!,1
Yes totally agree! It's never the right kind of brisket I feel like. Supermarket brisket is much too lean. It doesn't have that fat layer they got in these dishes,1
I always see brisket in all these Asian foods but I never see it for sale at the supermarket. Ugh.,1
"It's interesting to see each family's classic dim sum staples.

In my family, we always get the glutinous rice, eggplant, ha gow, and chicken feet, but rarely any of the others you ordered.",1

"So, how does one get adopted into your family?

Here (in eastern Massachusetts) we have decent (as far as I can tell) yum cha in China Town and heavily Asian communities like Quincy. Usually I've gone to China Pearl II in Quincy which has the added bonus of having great restraunts around it and Kam Man market, an AMAZING grocery for all things Asian.
I haven't had, for obvious viral reasons, dim sum since February New Year with my 10yo nephews.",1
Aww that look so good. What's the meat on top?,1
"Damn where is that?

Not where I live lol. We have dim sum here but get bad rep due to the spoiled mandrian people that don't want to work and cheap owners that don't know how to manage their restaurant.",1
This is from Ho Hung Kee in HK airport. Always need to get some bowls before my flights!,1

"I've only experience with cod and that's a pretty hardy, meaty fish that can withstand a bit of aggressive cooking. Swordfish and mahi mahi are also good contenders if you can source them. Not sure about the mercury in those, though.",1

I need this.,1
For a moment I read the title as Laduzi instead of Laziji... Looks so good :D,1

140C?,1
"The first thing is circular in shape, pretty firm, seems like some kind of mock meat but I don't think it's the mock duck that Companion sells. The second thing is much softer, closer to an egg, and I think it's braised gluten but can anyone confirm?",1
Looks good. Needs more dried chilli though. üòâ,1
"Quick blanche wings, then sous vide them with sauce. Pick your temp from &gt; 140C, and do it for at least 1 hour. Serve as is, pan fried or quick reboil as you wish.

Sauce is a typical soy chicken sauce, which you can also grab from asian markets if not familiar.

Otherwise for me, it's primarily dark soy, sugar, light soy, chinese wine(Shao Xing + Rose), star anise, sichuan pepper, white pepper, bay leaves. 

Heat the spices with ginger and scallions in oil without burning, then add liquid. Optionally add oyster sauce, salt and any of the 5 spice powder ingredients to taste.",1
"Thanks! I've been wanting to try making this. I didn't have a recipe until now! I actually have all the ingredients except the peppers, but I can get them. Yay!

This is a dish that (to me) isn't as hot as it looks. I like to make this type of dish in order to freak out my family.",1
That‚Äôs what I used!,1
Is the Sichuan bean paste mentioned douban jiang?,1
"I used to eat this all the time in China, along with some kind of sweet braised eggplant dish from a 10 kuai lunch box in Walmart. So dang good!",1
"I used fuschia Dunlop‚Äôs recipe in ‚Äúfood of sichuan‚Äù, it looks near identical to the version she also published [here](https://www.ft.com/content/a1095668-7d7a-11e3-a48f-00144feabdc0#axzz2qgEgwxwU)

I just used boneless skinless chicken thighs though vs breaking down a chicken which is obviously more legit",1
"Kinda the opposite. 

The point is it will just firm up at the lower temperature.

But with the higher temperature (like 165F) , it will disintegrate into the fall off the bone style like you said.",1
looks spicy!,1
Delicious and spicy,1
I had the same reaction the first time I learned about it haha!,1
I posted the [top](https://reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/jkwkvc/when_you_open_the_lid_to_check_your_claypot_rice/) previously but forgot the money shot.,1
Looks legit.  Nice work.,1
This,1
"Tell me that's clay pot rice with crust. 

Recipe?",1
Wow that's a lot of red peppers that looks really hot I would love some,1
Looks delicious. Recipe?,1
Just ate this today. This one looks even better!,1
Good idea,1
Yes. They do this with extra crispy youzhagwei in the place I like to goto in happy valley.,1
Do you have a recipe? Looks delicious!,1
"I am so jealous, I miss jook po. Especially the zhaliang and rice rolls. üò≠",1
"When I get visitors from China, I get them to bring me frozen shizitou. 

We eat that with fresh veg in a soup. 

Hong shao rou freezes well, as does [this](https://fatmiewchef.blogspot.com/2020/04/sweet-vinegar-ribs.html). 
Cook it low and slow to make sure it's very soft, as it will get tougher when microwaved. 


I think [turnip cake](https://fatmiewchef.blogspot.com/2020/04/turnip-cake-cantonese-hk-style.html) freezes well.",1
Á≥ØÁ±≥È•≠,1
"You should be able to buy this frozen. 

We also get frozen lion head meatballs that can be thrown into boiling water with veg for a quick soup that goes well with rice.",1
Âí∏ËõãËÇâÈ•º,1
"I need to get recipes for all 5 of these things one day. 

The tripe dish is hard I hear. I had a shop near my house once and asked the guy how to make this stuff at home - he said the amount of effort to clean the ingredients makes it tough.",1
"Cantonese style congee is awesome. And I realized I never took the time to learn how to make it properly. 

Mainly because it's so easily available everywhere.

Edit. I'm in Hong Kong",1
"There's slightly different spice profile, but yeah they are quite similar! Basically beef parts + daikon braised/stewed for hours, can't go wrong. :)

I haven't try freezing any of these, but they do keep well if properly maintained &amp; reheated. They develop a richer flavour, too.",1
"1-2-3-4-5 pork ribs are super easy and freeze well. 

Pork and winter melon soup.

I'm having a hard time thinking about veggies that freeze well though.",1
"Homemade jiaozi freeze well. You can cook them from frozen. Just boil three times like usual.

Fried rice of all descriptions freezes well. So does char siu pork. If she likes cold dishes you can pickle cabb2in the fridge.",1
Oh man I was thinking of like 5 different things lol.  There‚Äôs also simpler and perhaps shorter cooking time for similar beef with daikon from Japanese and Korean cooking.  But yes!! Both those dishes you mentioned have seasonings that you can use with various cuts of beef and it transfers really well over the different cuts.,1
"Interesting, I just never made congee from cooked rice before. I've combined rice and broth before but it's not quite the same as congee especially in terms of texture.",1
"Yeah, sometimes I make too much rice in my rice cooker and portion it out then freeze it. I use Japanese or Korean short grain rice and it works well. Just defrost the rice then cook in the microwave for 30 seconds. The texture doesn‚Äôt change much and its good if you cant be bothered to make rice. I‚Äôll just defrost it and put it in some chicken stock and make congee. I think you can freeze it again but not too sure. I suppose I would just defrost the rice then make congee for that day.",1
"I‚Äôm not even concerned with the doneness, I‚Äôm more concerned they look slimy. Like, it‚Äôs one thing to sous vide then fry, but this looks like all the skin is gonna slide off, flop on the tongue and just...eehhhh",1
You‚Äôre so welcome!! Good luck!!,1
"That sounds right.  My Cantonese is not great, mandarins better but my pinyin is awful.",1
Haha holy shit this is mindblowing. I should have known that time would matter but I haven't cared this whole time cooking. Thanks,1
USDA has time/temperature pasteurization tables for chicken here if anyone's curious: https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/bf3f01a1-a0b7-4902-a2df-a87c73d1b633/Salmonella-Compliance-Guideline-SVSP-RTE-Appendix-A.pdf?MOD=AJPERES,1
"I've tried it with cod and halibut, both worked fine.",1
"From your list I will suggest bass, halibut or sea bream.",1
"The strainer won't keep a piece of fish from falling apart. It will still break apart, just in the basket and end up floating out.",1
My family go-to is Tilapia as well,1
It does look undercooked. Not sure if that's safe.,1
"Its temperature + time:
165F for ~10 sec,
145F for ~30mins

A person won't die at 50C in 10 seconds, but will certainly if leave out long enough.",1
Always thought chicken was 165F,1
"It's actually pretty cook through, 148F for 2.5 hours. 

A actual rare chicken will be quite translucent.",1
You like your chicken medium rare too?,1
"Thanks. I‚Äôll freeze the rice in single servings defrost then make a congee.

I love congee, its nice with a bit salt, green onions and sesame oil for a topping.",1
"Beef or lamb and lo bok dish in a draining liquid is a good one! Or any northern style stews would keep or freeze well.

"I‚Äôd go with monkfish. It‚Äôs a very ‚Äúmeaty‚Äù fish, tends not to fall apart. I love the flavour as well.  

Edit: if you can, or if available near to you, support your local fishmonger! They have a wealth of knowledge.",1
"I often freeze a saucy sanbeiji and it comes out fine again reheated, specifically saucy because I think it freezes better.

Dumplings freeze well as long as you start them off on a tray or something until they're well frozen and then just throw them together in a bag. I've also frozen Italian-style meatballs before with the same method (keep them separate until fully frozen) so I bet shizitou lionhead meatballs would be the same.

Hongshao rou probably freezes as well. 

Best is probably all-in-one dishes or she'll miss out on the veg because most veggie side dishes won't freeze well imo.",1
"I can't offer much in the way of specific homestyle Chinese food, but saucy dishes always freeze/defrost well. That and dumplings! Hope your mum is doing okay!",1
definitely this!  I have a secret stash in our freezer!,1
"Honestly, most blached vegetables with a smothering of sauce made from garlic, soy sauce, black vinegar, salt, sichuan peppercorn, and powdered chilis, make for an easy to keep meal. Itll freeze well depending on what you cook too.

Just serve it over rice and it's delicious mala homestyle food.

You can sub out the chilis and peppercorns for pickled peppers for a nice change of pace too.",1
Slurry of cornstarch and cold water,1
"you've got some great suggestions here! I want to second the congee and also wanted to suggest sticky rice (nau mai fuan??). Its delicious, easy to make a big batch and reheats well in the microwave.

My family usually makes it with lap cheong, those little dried shrimps and shitake mushrooms, but I assume you can sub in other things as well.",1
"This, it's a lot of work but so, so good.",1
I'm sorry about your mom! This is a great question though - I second wontons and dumplings. I'd add scallion pancakes and Hua Juan as an easy thing to freeze and keep for awhile.,1
The first thing that came to mind is ham dan yuk bang. I know I bastardized it but it's literally salted egg meatloaf? Look up steamed pork patty and duck egg or a variation thereof.,1
If you portion and make the meat patties they can be cooked and steam on top of rice in a rice cooker. :D,1
"&gt;The stewed beef people love with noodles. Put some... beef stomach? With it? I can‚Äôt remember what cut it is. There‚Äôs a version where there‚Äôs pieces that have a lot of collagen? Possible also tripe. And some daikon. 

You might be thinking tendon! Beef Stew with Tendon &amp; Daikon is pretty popular in Cantonese cuisine and can be ordered with lo mein style noodles.

There is another version you can get at dimsum that is stomach/tripe mix. This version isn't traditional served with noodles.",1
"You can, I personally do not since I can make it in like 20-30 mins. üòÖ

Like most types of porridges, it should freeze and reheat okay and would avoid things like veggies, salty or century eggs, things that will change texture freezing. Lots of this can just be added during the reheating, too.",1
Oh! Zhongzi also freezes and reheat well!!,1
"Also in the UK. Use the cheap frozen 'white fish' fillets you can buy from any supermarket. They usually come in packs of 6-8. They're usually something like pollock. But being frozen is key. They dont flake and disappear into nothing like fresh fillets do. Plus if its something really spicy which I usually cook, you're hardly getting the delicate flavour of some expensive fish anyway. I use the same fish for Ê∞¥ÁÖÆÈ±º ( shui zhu yu - water boiled fish ) too.",1
"Wow these are some amazing ideas! I've never heard of the ground pork/egg thing but it sounds really delicious, I'll have to try it. Thanks so much!",1
"Tilapia and basa were my first thoughts, but sadly I'm doing online grocery this week and the service I use doesn't stock either :(",1
"
Sorry bout her arm, that sucks :((( hope she gets better when her body decides to heal!! 

Pot stickers keep well in the freezer, easy to boil.  

Three cup chicken might keep well.  

Honestly, my Japanese friend makes his chashu like pepsi/Coke chicken and I also recently tried making chashu for ramen and that‚Äôs what it tasted like and it‚Äôs delicious and will probably keep and would be easy to reheat.  I just used pork belly like 2 inch thick, not rolled up. Instapot that shit

Steamed ground pork with salty egg, sorry idk what it‚Äôs called in chinese and or English.  But if you add finely shredded lotus root to the mix... it is literally bomb.com I love a good pork meat pie(is that the English name?) I see these at the 99 ranch deli section often, but those are just pork and black mushroom with seasoning, everyone makes theirs different.  

The stewed beef people love with noodles.  Put some... beef stomach? With it? I can‚Äôt remember what cut it is.  There‚Äôs a version where there‚Äôs pieces that have a lot of collagen? Possible also tripe.  And some daikon.  Or tofu skin.  

Ah yes, there is also... a ground pork with pickled mustard and black mushrooms or all mushrooms I dunno.  I‚Äôve seen and eaten this from the freezer section, this and the stewed beef were the two first Chinese frozen dinners I‚Äôd ever had.  And I‚Äôve made it myself, keeps pretty well in the freezer. 

Lotus root and mushrooms are good veggies that‚Äôll keep well after freezing, after cooking.  Lol too many ideas.  I‚Äôve had pork stir fried with tea mushrooms and lotus root that keeps well in the freezer.  But any combo of mushrooms would probably still be delicious.  

For veggies maybe trim/prep for her and she can blanch before eating.  Throw some whatever brown sauce on it.  The veggies don‚Äôt keep the best in the freezer but if it‚Äôs minced it might not matter but if she wants fresh fresh which she will probably crave.",1
Second this,1
Can you freeze congee?,1
Jook! Or rice congee. You can do different variations with different fixings for variety. It's my family go-to comfort food :),1
Haha it‚Äôs one of my addictions for sure ‚Äî I made it so frequently that I made a video for it too: [2-min video: Beef Chow Fun](https://youtu.be/haQaCtAGpmw),1
"Portuguese here. Nope, no cheese. I find the video on Egg Tarts from Binging with Babish good to get to know both PT and HK variaties.",1
"I have family friends who run restaurants, and they usually use tilapia because it‚Äôs relatively cheap.",1
"Chow fun noodles are definitely in my top favourites, looks great",1
"One solution is to... have like a strainer ladle thing, sorry I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôd call it.  And just do a quick rinse through of whatever protein instead of just letting it sink to the bottom of the hot pot where you may or may not find it til later.  

Oh monk fish is very tender, Id prob avoid that, it‚Äôs even hard to pick up with chopsticks when steamed on a plate.",1
"I don't know which is ""best"", but I have tried sea bass, cod and halibut and they were all fine.",1
"Hahahah, ok! Thanks!",1
"I see. I always deep fry the eggplants before stirfrying, but I've never coated them, will definitely try this. Thanks so much!",1
"Not only do they look like the sun, and track the sun, but they need a lot of the sun. A sunflower needs at least six to eight hours direct sunlight every day, if not more, to reach its maximum potential. They grow tall to reach as far above other plant life as possible in order to gain even more access to sunlight.",1
"Yes, sunflower oil is well suited for making chili oil. It is neutral in flavor and can be heated enough to both toast the chilies and extract their flavor.",1
"Hahahaha! There‚Äôs no ‚Äúbasic‚Äù when it comes to Sichuan food, only classic. I, as a born and raised Sichuan person, can‚Äôt live without my Sichuan peppercorn and pickled aromatics. And baby bok choy was pretty much the only veggie my mom could get me to eat as a kid!",1
That looks amazing.,1
"Wanna try making steamed egg? It‚Äôs super easy, just beat egg and water (volume ratio 1:1.5), add salt and hoisin sauce to taste, then steam over boiling water on low heat till solidified. Serve with a dash of soy sauce and sesame oil. (2 eggs takes about 14 min to steam)",1
Hungry,1
Haha thanks!!,1
It was mixed in ‚Äî and it doesn‚Äôt look like Bolognese to me either...,1
