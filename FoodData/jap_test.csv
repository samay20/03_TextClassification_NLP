Thank you! üíò,0
Yep! First time. I just let myself take my time.,0
Ah! That sounds awesome.,0
Thank you so much!,0
Looks delicious!,0

Mmmmmhhhmmm..  looks so good!,0
I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre not foot-shaped. That would be gross.,0
Do not refrigerate.  They are meant to last at room temp from morning to lunch time.,0
Where do you buy it,0
"Well I wasn‚Äôt so much saying they wouldn‚Äôt dry out before a week, more of that from a food safety perspective they‚Äôd easily last week, but will definitely start drying out before you run into food safety issues. If you wrap them in plastic wrap, they should keep from drying out for a little bit longer.",0
Mine were dried out the next morning :(. How do you prolong their fridge life?,0
That‚Äôs a great combo!,0
"Easily a week, but the rice will start to dry out.",0

Thank you.,0
"First time?! Damn, those look picture perfect. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I make mine, to this day? They look like shit, lol.",0
definitely inspired me to try and make a tuna mayo one,0
I want one so bad! They look phenomenal.,0
We are currently quarantining in Tokyo after flying from the US.  My wife's friend sent us A5 wagyu for sukiyaki to celebrate our entry to Japan.,0

How long do they last in the fridge? Wondering for work lunches,0
Charcoal-grilled.Rotate 180 degrees on a regular basis.,0

Thank you ü•∞,0
"So I don‚Äôt really have a recipe as much as tips I can offer! So I rinsed and cooked short-grain rice completely, let it cool, prepped my filling (special smoked salmon, Kewpie, salt, pepper, soy sauce), put half of the rice in my hand, filling in, and then press another half of rice, squeeze it into a ball, and slowly shape. I dressed with a piece of nori and dipped in some furikake.",0
They look adorable! Would you mind sharing the recipe?,0
It looks like mirin to me-says ‚Äúmirin type‚Äù on it.,0
The smiley face made my day,0
This is me rn because im pregnant... i have wanted sushi SOOO bad,0
thank you!!!,0
Yeah it‚Äôs mirin seasoning.,0
Yummm that sounds like the next recipe to me hehe!,0
thanks :),0
"The one on top is non-Japanese uramaki. The bottom one is a non-Japanese futomaki with springled rice on the outside. 

They are sushi as much as a ""sushi burrito"" is sushi. But then again, what do I know?",0
"It's an uramaki and a tatemaki. And these are facts, not opinions.",0
I see non-Japanese futomaki and an opinionated non-Japanese cheff.,0
"Very true! Thank you you‚Äôve gave me a lot to think about I wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise haha I‚Äôve started researching what small businesses such as mine (Insta page businesses) are around my area and most are desserts such as cheesecakes and things like that, which is why I have leant towards Japanese cuisine as it‚Äôs more interesting and less available whereas dessert parlour is far more overcrowded in my area.It‚Äôs just knowing what dishes would be most applicable for my delivery and what would have longest shelf life for how much it costs to makeüò¨

Staff would mainly be me so will need to flex my multi tasking skills haha It‚Äôs mainly as a side income so will only accept as much work load as I can.
Will get writing in my business pad! Any other comments or help you‚Äôd share I‚Äôd appreciate:)",0
Now I want sushi,0
Those are awesome,0

You may not need to go through writing out an ""official"" business plan that you're going to submit to a financial backer, but any type of business (ie where you sell goods or services in exchange for money) should go through some scrutiny, research and a detailed plan.  

For example, What's your background as a chef?  What cooking supplies and food supplies do you have access to?  How much staff do you have?  What are your financials like/what sort of budget are you on/where is your funding coming from?  What are your demographics/who are you looking to sell to?  Who are your competitors? etc.  Keep in mind, each of these questions would require many of it's own questions, esp regarding your market/demographics and financials.  

It's not unheard of for people to just ""wing it"" and be successful but you're generally much better off having a clear understanding of the who, what, when, where, why, how of what you're trying to do first.",0

My mouth is drooling...,0
American style Maki I see.,0
"I know it‚Äôs not originally from Japan, but Basque-style cheesecakes are huge in Japan, and I‚Äôve been wanting to make a Matcha version of it since I saw it at Lawson‚Äôs last summer. The combo works super well with the mildly bitter matcha balancing out the sweetness and richness of the custardy cheesecake. The whole thing comes together from 5 ingredients thrown together in a blender and blasted in an oven until the top is caramelized and the center is a silky smooth custard. If you want to try it out, I made a video with [the recipe](https://youtu.be/RdokDO24Ka0).",0
Shrimp tempura,0
"You're right, it's not real traditional Japanese food, it's an offshoot that blends the elements of one culture's food with another. But since it utilizes vinegar-seasoned rice and has a strong Japanese influence, it is by definition still sushi, it's just not traditional Japanese sushi.

You're arguing that your definition of sushi, which would be traditional Japanese sushi, is the only real sushi. I'm arguing that the dictionary definition of sushi better defines what is and is not sushi.

Traditional Japanese sushi and westernized sushi are both quite different, but they're both still sushi.",0

"This isn‚Äôt Japanese food tho. I‚Äôm Japanese and we never have seaweed on the inside of the rice, or put avocados in sushi or put any kind of sauce (other than soy sauce) on rolls. My parents laughed at this kind of food when they visited the uk because while this is technically sushi it‚Äôs def not actually sushi or Japanese. We call sashimi sushi sometimes bc no one gives a shit about the actual origins of the word or what it technically means",0
"Thanks, and trying to improve little by little!",0
"Not bad buddy , but work more on filming quality üòâ",0
Ayu is my favorite fish to eat! It is one of the biggest reasons I look forward to summer.,0
"Yes it is.

Sushi is any japanese dish prepared with vinegar-seasoned sushi rice. It doesn't have to be raw, it doesn't have to be fish, and it doesn't have to be nigiri. Sashimi however is technically not sushi, since it is served without the seasoned sushi rice. If it's Japanese cuisine and has vinegar-seasoned rice, no matter what the other ingredients are or how it's made, it's sushi.

I worked as a sushi chef for a little under 7 years",0
Whats the one with what looks to be some sort of soy-based sauce on it?,0
Are you trying to make me cry!? I want this in my life right now,0
[deleted],0
What is this cooking process called? Looks interesting. Do they rotate the poles? How do they keep it consistent?,0
"No, it's a starchy potato called Taro. It does not look as shiny and well cut as it should, but damn was it tasty ü§©",0
"I know  but as I tend to kick over liquids with my right hand, I put it to the left, as I did with my tea ;)",0
"This post is either not Japanese food, or the Japanese food is not the focus of the post.",0
"Technically, that's not sushi. But what do I know. It looks mouthwatering anyway.",0
[removed],0
Looks fresh af.,0
Is the bowl on the lower right a bamboo shoot?,0
I wish my lunches looked as delicious as this.,0
It is the basic manners to set rice on the left and miso soup on the right.,0
Not Japanese food,0
Love it! Your welcome at mine anytime (i make a killer katsu curry),0
"Around an hour. Set the rice cooker first, taroimos took ~40 minutes, the rest could be done in between blanching, braising and seasoning them.",0
"No, then I think I am thinking of Ukiah -I've never driven through and not stopped at the stop lights. I remember a few years back, there was always construction for the diversion, that can't be more than a few years old",0
How I wish I was there.,0
"might be thinking of another town, the 101 does not go thru stoplights in ukiah, its all a self contained highway with exits and all that like in the city...you might be thinking of a town further north, or things have been renovated in the meantime - south of ukaih is hopland, then cloverdale...101 goes right thru cloverdale without actually going into town and hopland has no stop lights",0
Thank you!! Japanese cooking feels like arts and crafts- my two favorite things at one time heheüíùthe Yukari balances the umami flavors so well~ yes I found a great tamagoyaki pan at my local Korean grocery!,0
"It's literally in the gas station on the 101 (yeah I say *the*), at the stoplight. I think it's a Mobil, and there's a little restaurant adjoining. I'd stop there coming and going. Also south of town, as your driving in there's a road that cuts east and there at least to be a food truck down there most days, and they were really good.

I haven't spent a lot of time in Ukiah but it's a crossroads north to south, or over to Fort Bragg, so that's where I'd always aim to eat. This was all eight years ago, and highschool in the nineties before that, so I imagine things have changed a little -wait, did they bypass Ukiah with the 101 or am I thinking of another town, maybe further south?",0
"whats the spot? ukiah is the closest actual town to me, not many great places to eat to my tastes...i grew up in the bay and got pretty deep into food so i am spoiled. the brewery has a crazy good burger but its mostly in n out for me when i go to town. or rockseas in hopland, or the reuben at golden pig also in hopland",0
Recipe please,0
"Looks good, tell us about it!",0
"I‚Äôm curious (or maybe it was already mentioned?), is that cake in the left hand corner?",0

"I love Mendo! Oddly enough, some of the best Mexican food I've ever had is in Ukiah. It's a beautiful place to live, my dude. I used to grow indoor outside of Carlotta on the 36. It was family, pretty small, but it was a good time while it lasted.",0
"Eh, I enjoy blanching anyway. Something about ice baths just works for me.",0
Recipe?,0
[removed],0
I prefer 100% too especially for cold soba. If for hot soba noodles and if you put toppings like tempura 2:8 would be still very yummy.,0
Everything looks cute and yummy! It‚Äôs impressive you used yukari for onigiri and Nori.  You have those square pan for egg?,0

"Buncha short sighted sonsaguns, ain‚Äôt they.",0
I‚Äôd say go for it!  Just make sure you get your plants/seeds from a viable source.  Seeds are nearly impossible to find and many are scammed into buying mustard or other brassicas - good luck!,0
"Wow, thank you so much!!  I can‚Äôt tell you how nice that is!!",0
Coming over to eat now üòä,0
Thank you!!,0
"I tagged a sustainable sushi restaurant in Chico, CA on your IG account. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd be interested in using your wasabi when you‚Äôre ready. Good luck!! 

I serendipitously joined this subreddit the other day and was so surprised to see a Northern California post in it.",0
Wow :-),0
Thank you!! :D,0
"Just try it
(ok, maybe not daily if you're not staying in Japan... but I'm not living in Japan, so no excuses! ;P)",0
I wish I could make food like that... Makes me want to move to Japan just to taste it daily :-),0
Looks great! Also love your plates!,0

"I‚Äôm in actually from Chiang Mai! 

We do have some property in the mountains 800m above sea level or so, where it‚Äôs quite cool. I‚Äôve heard of some people farming wasabi in Northern Thailand  but couldn‚Äôt find any info on it.

Flowing water is the only thing we‚Äôre missing. Everything is pumped up around here. 

Thanks for sharingb",0

"Lava tubes are natural formations formed under volcanoes that allow water to flow through and emerge as springs.  We used a combination of andesite (dense/inert), black and red basalt (very porous, mineral rich - same thing as pumice, but basalt comes from deeper volcanic activity) and 1‚Äù river rock.  My concern in Thailand would be water temperature.  This is a cold weather plant, especially the root system requirements.   Maybe Chang mai or northern mountains would have cold enough springs - plant hates direct sunlight",0
"Hey uh I know this post wasn‚Äôt for advertisement but do you sell the mature rhizomes to the public?   Just FYI I‚Äôm Japanese, live in SoCal, and sashimi is a weekly thing at home.

Edit: I do buy nama wasabi from the market on very special occasions but just wondering if there‚Äôs a direct to consumer option.",0
"Oh man, can you share any info on how to grow? Would like to try this in Thailand :-]

Are you using pumice when you say Lava tube?

Edit:

I see you‚Äôre sharing a lot of info below this is cool!",0

"Fried tofu with springonion-soysauceslurrysauce and shichimi pepper, taroimo no nimono, tomatosalad with yuzujosh√¥-kewpie-dressing, renkon misosoup and umeboshi on rice. Was soooo yummy!! (‚òÜ_‚òÜ)",0
"K. Sounds like it will be just fine in the fridge for about forever; it will likely continue to pick up flavor over the first week or two, as the acids go to work, which is likely what the recipe meant (you usually wait a week or two with most pickles to reach full flavor absorption. 

Like with other pickling liquids you can keep reusing the pickling liquid. Just remember that the more times you use it the more water from ingredients will dilute it, so every now and then adding some more vinegar to keep the pH sufficiently low wouldn't be a bad idea--and you can add more mirin/soy as needed to maintain the flavor. 

Just keep an eye out for any mold that may form (it shouldn't since it's acidic enough) or really spoiled smells.",0
"I blanched the quartered burdock root sections and placed them in a mason jar. Threw in some roughly chopped garlic and ginger.

Added 1 cup rice vinegar, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup mirin, and 1 cup water plus a little more to bring the level high enough.

It's been in the refrigerator, yes.",0
Thank you and best of luck!!,0
The oops line sold me lol,0
"Probably worth it. If hydroponics is artificial life support for plants, Aquaponics is life support for fish and then expecting the fish to take care of the plants. Eek!

I have experience with patio garden level hydro and experience with small aquarium keeping, but I think that‚Äôd be worth about beans on the commercial level.  When ‚Äúoops‚Äù might mean ya don‚Äôt eat this year, might be with it to learn from someone else‚Äôs mistakes rather than your own.",0
Oh wow!!! This is both fabulous and beautiful! I love the Shasta area. Cheers fellow NorCal farmer!,0
Can I ask what the volume of each liquid ingredient was? Did you boil and pour over or just put the burdock in the tepid solution? Are you refrigerating it?,0

"We are actually thinking of using it as a shade plant over summer!!  Only problem is the city of Weed, ironically, doesn‚Äôt allow outdoor weed grows",0
"These plants once rooted DO NOT like to be messed with.  Like you, I learned that the hard way.  Apparently this is why wasabi doesn‚Äôt work in hydroponic systems as well; the roots need to ‚Äòcling‚Äô to thrive, and once established, that‚Äôs it.",0
"Exactly and great information.  I‚Äôm actually thinking of taking an aquaponics course at Ourobouros Farms in half moon bay.  $1k for full weekend class, do you think that‚Äôs worth it?  The main variable with wasabi is time.  If anything holds them back or stunts growth, they might never recover.  And with harvest time taking minimum 12 months, minimizing growth mistakes is critical",0
No it was a cold water one with little fauna. I had the plant for a couple of years then made the mistake of potting it and it rotted.   I was in Washington state and just playing around with the local stream flora.,0
"Your welcome!  People are tired of hearing me talk wasabi, so this is perfect therapy",0
"I thought I‚Äôd scoured the entire internet for wasabi videos, but I‚Äôve never heard of that show!!   I‚Äôll look for it, but could you possibly post a link?  Thank you!

You should check out wasabi Betin Japanology with Peter Barakan, he‚Äôs done a couple great segments on wasabi",0
"If it was tropical fish in the aquarium, that water would be way too hot for the plant.  But that‚Äôs a great idea if you were raising cold water fish (ie trout)",0
That‚Äôs really interesting.  I grew a single wasabi plant from rhizome years ago in a planted aquarium.  It was on/above the surface.   I thought it was a struggle to keep it happy but I didn‚Äôt have to deal with predation.  I hope your harvest is great.,0

Mebbe start growing some bud...a nice wasabi/weed hybrid...

Cannel√©s are French.,0
Okay thanks for all the help dude,0
Sort tofu already have the plenty of moisture so no need to dry them.,0
Ah I understand sorry! When I said raw I meant like do you fry/bake it first not actually raw raw. So to have it soft do I press it at all or just not too much?,0
"Dude.. tofu is cooked ok. There ain‚Äôt no raw tofu as it‚Äôs a biproduct of boiling beans. Use soft and not firm tofu. Put it on the bowl
And pour boiling miso soups.",0
Hi OP that looks amazing! I‚Äôm planning on making miso soup later today and I‚Äôm wondering do you put the tofu in raw or cooked as I‚Äôve never done it before and the recipe doesn‚Äôt state which?,0
"The plants will tell you if there‚Äôs too much nitrogen. I‚Äôm not familiar with wasabi culture specifically, but in my experience with hydroponic strawberries and veggies, it was really obvious really quickly if I‚Äôd pooched the nutrient mix. The plants would look fabulous for a few hours, and then pretty much just fall right over. If I flushed immediately and hoped hard enough, the plants would perk up and be back to usual in a couple days. If I just left it go, well, whatever I had growing usually got transplanted to the Big Greenhouse in the Sky. Fortunately I learned that one on lettuce from the hardware store and I still had most of the seed packet left. It would be absolutely heartbreaking to learn the hard way on fancy pantsy cell cultured wasabi!",0
You‚Äôre welcome!  Thanks for the interest,0
"Thank you!!  This is actually a run-off stream from a small pond on our property.  We had a few Eastern Brookies in there, but a huge Great Blue Heron plucked them right out!  I‚Äôm a little worried about too much nitrogen content, but the fun is in experimenting!",0
"I think the plant individually isn‚Äôt super hard to grow.  But it is VERY hard to produce decent rhizomes without flowing water and it can take years for quality harvest.  Also, growing commercially or in large groups the plant is highly prone to sweeping disease.",0
"Thank you!!  Appreciate the kind words.  The vision you speak of is what led me to shovel till my hands bled and has kept me up till late the last year!  If it works, I think the best part will be it‚Äôs such a clean plant to grow that it actually protects and harmonizes nature vs. a lot of current farming practices...",0
