"Today we are making Qian Li Xiang Huntun (千里香馄饨). Huntun is wonton. Qian means a thousand. Li is an ancient unit of length, which equals 500 meters. Xiang means fragrance or aroma. So the name is trying to tell you that this wonton smells so good that the fragrance can spread out to 500 km away. That is a little bit exaggerated but it indeed smells amazing and tastes incredibly delicious. I am excited to share it with you.

**INGREDIENTS**

* 300 grams (10.6) oz of ground chicken
* 200 grams (7 oz) of peeled shrimp
* 100 grams (3.5 oz) of garlic chives or scallion
* 1.3 big size onion, diced
* 18 cloves of garlic
* 2 inches of ginger thinly.
* 3 scallions, cut into 2 inches pieces
* 1.5 cup of vegetable oil (I am using corn oil)
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 star anise
* 2 cloves
* 2 dried red chilies, optional
* 1.5 tbsp of soy sauce
* 1.5 tbsp of fish sauce
* 1 tbsp of oyster sauce
* 1 tbsp of chinese cooking wine
* Black pepper to taste
* 1 pack of wonton wrapper (50-55 pieces)
* 8 cups 1.9 liters of chicken stock or water
* 1 tbsp of salt to season the broth
* 1/2 cup of cold water to drop the temperature
* Baby bok choy or other green vegetables
* Diced scallion as garnish
* Pickled long beans or other pickles as toppings optional

**INSTRUCTIONS**

* Soak 1 cinnamon stick, 2 bay leaves, 1 star anise, 2 pieces of clove, and 3 pieces of dried red chilies with some hot water for 20 minutes. This is to give the spices a little bit of moisture which will allow them to transfer the flavor to the oil without burning. Set it aside.
* Dice 1 + 1/3 of a big onion. Try to use purpose onion, so the fragrance can be stronger.
* Dice 18 cloves of garlic, you can use more if you want. Optionally, put the garlic in a sieve and rinse it with running water. When the garlic is crushed and chopped, it will release a type of chemical called mercaptans, which makes your knife, cutting board sticky. That chemical is what we are trying the rinse off because it will bring a bitter taste when deep-fried. Dried it with paper towels. Set it aside.
* Cut 3 scallions into 2 inches long pieces.
* Slice 2 inches of ginger finely.
* Dice 100 grams of garlic chive. You can use other types of vegetables if you want. Such as mushrooms, carrots, cabbage, scallion...
* Pour 1.5 cups of oil into the wok. The onion contains more moisture compared to other ingredients so we will add it to the wok first. Turn the heat to medium-low. Simmer the onion for 5 minutes. Add in the rest of the aromatics (garlic, ginger slices, scallion strips, and the soaked but well-drained spices). Stir it constantly. Make sure to use your spatula to scrape the bottom of the wok so nothing sticks. Continue to simmer everything on medium-low heat for another 20  minutes or until the onion and garlic are lightly golden.
* Let everything go through a sieve. Take your time to pick out all the spices, scallions, and ginger slices. They have done their job, we don’t need them anymore.
* We will use the fried garlic and the onion to make the filling later. Store the aromatic oil in a jar. It will stay good in the fridge for 2 months. This is good stuff, you can drizzle the oil over wonton soup, noodle soup, hot and sour soup. It will bring the dish to another level. I also like to add a little bit of it to my stir-fries. The fragrance will give you a nice feeling when you put the dish on the table. It can also be a replacement for sesame oil if you are allergic to sesame.
* Next, we will make the filling. Roughly diced 200 grams of peeled and deveined shrimp. In a big mixing bowl, combine the shrimp, 300 grams of ground chicken thigh.
* Season with 1.5 tbsp of soy sauce, 1.5 tbsp of fish sauce, 1 tbsp of oyster sauce, 1 tbsp of Chinese cooking wine, and some white pepper to taste.
* Stir the protein within 1 direction for 5 minutes to develop the texture. Add the fried aromatics, and the diced garlic chives or any other vegetables that you like. Keep stirring the filling until everything is well combined.
* Next, we will wrap the wonton. I am using store-bought wrappers because making them from scratch is time-consuming and you can buy wonton wrappers easily in Walmart and target. Be sure to put them out 40 minutes ahead at room temperature to defrost.
* The wrapping is really easy. You just put some filling in the middle. Gather the edge together and pinch to close it. Even a 3-year-old kid can do it. This recipe is enough to make 50-60 pieces of the wonton. That will be 4 or 5 servings.
* **Storing tip:** Wonton is freezer-friendly. If you like this recipe, you can double or triple the amount. Put them in a sealed container. Use plastic wrap to keep each layer separate. Frozen wonton is one of my quick and tasty breakfasts. Whenever you want to eat them again, don’t need to defrost, just boil them directly.
* Ok, let’s cook the wonton. Pour in 8 cups of chicken stock into the pot. Season it with some salt by taste. Cover it and bring it to a boil. I am just using the store-bought stock as it is fast and easy. There is no need to spend hours making your own broth for this recipe, because, With the deep fry onion and garlic, the wonton is going to taste amazing.
* When the broth comes to a boil, use your spoon to swirl the water to create a cyclone. Then put in the wonton. This way, they will flow with the water instead of sinking to the bottom directly. Otherwise, they will stick to the bottom and loss a part of the skin.
* The temperature of the pot will drop immediately after you add the wonton. Keep the heat at medium-low. Wait until they float to the top of the water and the pot should come back to a simmer. Then add 1/2 cup of cold water to drop the temperature. Wait for the pot to come back to a simmer again. This method is call dian len shui. Whether your wonton is frozen or fresh, you can use the same method and the wonton will be fully cooked. Don’t worry about the timing because if the wonton is frozen, it takes longer for it to float to the top of the water and come to a simmer.
* while waiting for the pot to come back to a boil, you can quickly cut some baby bok choy or you can use other green leafy vegetables that you like.
* When the pot is simmering, add in the vegetables. Let it blanch with the wontons for 20 seconds to a minute depending on your preference. And you are done.
* Serve them in a bowl, you can do 8-15 pieces per serving depending on your appetize.
* Here comes the most important part to make this qianlixiang wonton - drizzle in 1-2 tbsp of the aromatic oil. The heat from the soup will reactivate the fragrance. Sprinkle some diced scallion as a garnish.",1
"It's better than the places I've been to in NYC. Duck Chang's in NOVA is pretty good too, though he usually doesn't bring it out to the table to carve it in front of you(usually he's up front so you can still see it). I recall China Wok near Tyson's being pretty good too. Great China in East Bay ain't bad either. It's been too long since I've been to Beijing. I have been wanting to try it at Da Dong there.",1

thanks. Do I mix the salt and the baking soda in water with the shrimp? or just mix the baking soda and salt into the shrimp?,1
Brine them in salt and baking soda before cooking. You want 1tsp of kosher salt (or 1/2 tsp table salt) and 1/4 tsp baking soda per 450g of shrimp. Let them brine for 15 mins to an hour in the fridge.,1

Your dough looks too soft. I usually use 40-45 g of water on 100 g of flour.,1
"Understandable, honestly. Sometimes, I get so frustrated that I just buy the store-bought wrappers. Can't seem to get them right myself!",1

Also i will also mention Chef Wang for his very clear/concise videos and technical notes. He's a real chef so very knowledgeable. His ingredients may be a little more difficult to source though because he's not targeting a western audience, but an excellent reference if you wana go full tilt into Szechuan chef mimicry.

"I'm not sure exactly what you're doing that's wrong but I know that when I make it I either sit there and baste the chicken constantly for 40 min if I'm doing a whole chicken, or I have a vat of reuseable soya sauce mixture that I completely submerged and boil chicken pieces in for like 40 mins. If your dark soya is dark and your chicken is getting even contact with the sauce I think it should be alright.",1
"My pleasure, please let me know how it goes! The bean sprout salad is one of my favorite dishes to make.",1

There's a lot of them out there that differ in sauce ingredients but I used this: https://youtu.be/Z1HxZXwdgiU,1
"I did, it was easy and totally worth it",1
It's one of my favourite vegetables.  It's sort of like a cross between spinach and cabbage but with a much more subtle and delicate flavour.  If you like spinach or cabbage I'm sure you'll like bok choy. I often chop it up and add it to ramen noodles when I'm short on time.,1
"My favorites are Magic Ingredients (she does a mix of recipes but mainly Chinese) https://youtube.com/c/MagicIngredients

Bok choy was my college food. I usually boil them and just taste like hmm soft and like other veggies bland. I usually eat it with oyster sauce and it's bomb.,1

"I honestly don't think this subreddit is even remotely toxic and if you like Chinese food I'd encourage you to keep following it even if you feel like I've treated you unfairly in this thread. You'll find a lot of great dishes and recipes here. The thing is that your disappointing dinner wasn't really relevant to this post, so that and your following comments came across as just sort of smarmy. If you were trying to say ""I wish that what I had eaten was as good as this looked"" then that was not my take away from your comment. If you can't cook well then yes, that is your fault. If you do not possess a basic skill set (and home cooking is a basic skillset that every adult should have), that's on you. If you know the fundamentals of home cooking then a lot of Chinese dishes are accessible. 

I don't have any problems with you and I hope you don't become discouraged about trying new Chinese restaurants or learning how to cook for yourself. Again, I tried to give you resources to help you have better experiences with Chinese food. You might think I'm going after you but I'm really not. If I seem standoffish I'm just reflecting the energy I got from your comments. I hope you and everyone else has great experiences with Chinese food.",1

But you are going on long rants about how ignorant I am and that it's my own fault that I can't find good Chinese food or cook well. Wtf?

"Dude you are really going off topic. All I said was that I had bad Chinese food. I woke up and saw this post and I was remembering the bad food the night before. There was nothing snooty about saying that. Wake up

Just because making Chinese food is easy for you, doesn’t mean it’s going to be easy for everyone else. Your comments sound snooty to me.",1
"Dude, your original comment came across as pretty snooty and ignorant. I'm not just laying shit on you. If you want good Chinese food and don't have any places near you, learn how to cook it. Check out Chinese Cooking Demystified on YouTube. I'd also recommend Xi'an's Famous Foods by Jason Wang (cookbook based on the menu at the NYC restaurant of the same name - specializing in Shanxi-style cuisine) and Fuchsia Dunlop's books. She was the first westerner to attend the Sichuan Institute of Higher Cuisine and her books are mostly region based, Land of Plenty (on Sichuan cooking) is probably my favorite of hers but Every Grain of Rice is on home-cooking and might be the most accessible for a beginner. It's not hard to learn the basics and a lot of the techniques are transferable to other styles of cooking and everyone should have at least descent home-cooking skills.  If you don't have a local Asian grocery store and have trouble finding stuff locally, again, Yamibuy and other websites should be able to get you most ingredients you need.

If you check out that YouTube channel, read even just one of those books, and put some time into establishing good foundations, then I promise you will be able to make Chinese food that is good and authentic.",1
"Imagine shitting all over someone for saying that they **personally** don't know anyone who can cook Chinese food well. Thanks for making me feel like a piece of shit because I can't find good food near my house. 

This sub is so welcoming. 

Obviously I sub here because I like the food. Just because I can't cook well or find authentic Chinese food does not mean that it's my own fault or that I'm ignorant. Wtf it's just cuisine, you're acting like I insult your way of life or something",1
"You can make Chinese food at home. There are plenty of sources online to find authentic recipes and you can source hard to get ingredients from sites like Yamibuy. It's 2021, if you haven't had good, authentic Chinese food, that's your own fault. I find it hard to believe that anyone with good taste who has had authentic and properly prepared cuisine from Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, Shandong, etc. came away with a bad impression. 

If your take away from this post is ""Personally, I don't know many people who can cook Chinese food well anyways"" you just come across as ignorant. I don't know why you want to subscribe to this sub if that's your view on Chinese food but do whatever you want, I don't care.",1
What's your point though? Should I not subscribe to this sub because I don't have a good Chinese food places by my house,1
How was I shitting on Chinese food by commenting that I had some low quality Chinese food,1
"You just know this guy lives somewhere in rural America without a single authentic Chinese restaurant and his experience with ""Chinese"" food consists of beef with broccoli, crab rangoon, General Tso's chicken, and orange chicken.",1
way too much precision to be considered shitty by me but i guess they could look like turds now that the thought has been planted in my brain from the comments sec.,1
Imagine shitting on Chinese food on r/chinesefood.,1

"How To Make Black Pepper Beef Recipe At Home l Easy Chinese Stir Fry

Full Video Recipe:

[https://youtu.be/ZOkoVGn2pGo](https://youtu.be/ZOkoVGn2pGo)

Learn how to make this chinese black pepper beef stir fry at home with me today and be rewarded with a life time of sweat and delight from the intensity of the black peppers. While the recipe calls for bell peppers and onions, feel free to use beansprouts, carrots and whatever vegetable that may be in season. 

You will need:

For the Sauce (This makes about 5 stir fries worth of sauce)

1 Medium Sized Onion, finely minced (or about 100g)

8 Cloves of Garlic, finely minced (or about 70g) 

5g of Ginger, finely minced

30g Black Peppercorns

2 tbsp of Oyster Sauce

2 tbsp of Chu Hou Sauce (a type of fermented black bean sauce – this really adds a lot of body to the sauce so I highly recommend it)

0.5 Tbsp of Dark Sauce

0.5 Tbsp of Soy Sauce

1 Tsp of MSG

1 Tbsp of Shaoxing Rice Wine

1.5 Cup of Chicken Stock

3 Tbsp of Neutral Vegetable Oil

For the marinating of the Beef

225g (8Oz) of slice beef (I used flank steak, but you can use chuck or sirloin as well)

1 Tbsp of Oyster Sauce

1 Tsp of Dark Soy Sauce

1 Tbsp of Egg White

2 Tsp of Cornstarch

2 Tsp of Shaoxing Rice Wine

1 Tsp of Sugar

For the Stir Fry

3 Cloves of minced Garlic, finely minced

1 thin strip of garlic, finely minced

1/2  of a Medium Sized Onion, chopped in medium sized pieces

1/2  of a Medium Green Capsicum, chopped in medium sized pieces

1/2  of a Medium Red Capsicum, chopped in medium sized pieces

1 Tbsp Shaoxing Wine

0.5 tbsp Cornstarch (mixed with 1 Tbsp spoon of Water to make a slurry)

Steps:

Lightly toast your black peppercorns over a medium heat is a pan for 2-3 minutes. Stir constantly to avoid burning the black peppercorns. Next, remove the black peppercorns from the pan and give it a good pounding with a pestle and mortar.

Add 3 Tbsp of neutral vegetable oil into a hot wok. Next add the minced garlic, onions and ginger and stir fry for about 2-3 minutes to allow the flavours to intensify. Now add the pounded black peppercorns and stir fry for another minute. Once you smell the spicy vapours of the black peppercorns, add the oyster sauce, chuhou sauce, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce and Shaoxing rice wine and stir fry for another 2-3 minutes. Once you get a nice sticky paste, add 3/4 cup worth of stock (I used chicken stock, but you can use vegetable stock or beef stock if you want) and allow the sauce to simmer for about 3-4 minutes. Once the sauce starts to thicken again, add in your remaining 3/4 cup worth of stock. Once the sauce starts to simmer, turn the heat off and bottle it up. This recipe should nicely fit into a mason jar and can be used for about 5 stir fries. 

For the beef marinate, start by slicing your beef into thin strips. Next add the oyster sauce, dark sauce, Shaoxing rice wine, egg white, cornstarch and sugar. Allow to marinate for at least 30 minutes.

\*\*\* I know most black pepper beef recipes out there (and restaurants) will add sodium bicarbonate to tenderize the beef. My family avoids this practice because we find that we do not really enjoy the texture of beef that has been treated in this manner and we find that it causes the beef to feel rather weird/unnatural.\*\*\* 

\*\*\* I know that the recipe calls for 1 Tbsp of egg white. To measure this out easily, first whip up the egg whites (after you have separated it from the egg yolk) to break the structure of the egg white (trust me this really helps!). I usually use 1 Tbsp of egg white to every 225g (8 Oz of meat). Any more than that and I find that the meat does not brown as nicely due to the excess moisture. What do I do with this remaining egg white and egg yolk? I usually fry the left over egg whites first and add the egg yolk to make a reconstructed (al beit) smaller sunny side up, but you can just make an omelette for yourself lol.\*\*\*

When you are ready to stir fry the dish, heat up your wok over high heat. Once the wok is hot, add 3-4 tbsp of cold neutral vegetable oil and evenly coat the wok. Now add in your marinated beef strips and stir fry for about 30 – 45 seconds and remove the beef from the wok. We are going to be frying the beef again later with the sauce so we do not want to over cook it here. Its ok if the beef is still a little raw.

Now clean your wok and heat it up again. Once the wok is hot, add in 2 tbsp of cold neutral vegetable oil along with your minced garlic and ginger and stir fry until the garlic is nicely browned. Next, add the onion and capsicums and stir fry for about 30 seconds. Now add the beef back into the wok, along with 1 Tbsp of Shaoxing rice wine and about 3 Tbsp worth of the black pepper sauce we prepared. Finish off with the cornstarch slurry and once the sauce thickens, turn off the heat and serve the black pepper beef immediately.",1
"Personally, I don't know many people who can cook Chinese food well anyways. maybe your roast is a stretch",1
You shouldn't talk about your Mom's cooking like that,1
The Chinese food I had last night was so bad. Never going there again,1
The skid mark really brings it to life,1
"Yeees! Silicon liner. I have a few actually, but only one was clean at the time I was cooking the buns, so I used parchment paper for the other steamer.",1
Is the top one a reusable steamer liner?!,1
"My thoughts would be what they laden on top before they serve it. Perhaps a broth base. I’m sure it goes somewhere. The Chinese, too their credit, waste nothing. Still doesn’t hurt to ask.",1
The typical fashion.. I think my dough gets dried out a little as I'm getting to the last half of my batch stuffing the bao... And I have to squish the folds together really hard or something.,1
"Unfortunately I don't have a recipe for the filling -- I just mixed a bunch of leftover dishes to make the filling.

For the dough, I used 250g King Arthur all purpose flour, 150g 100F water, a pinch of salt, 3g instant yeast, 5g granulated sugar, 5g baking powder.",1
How do you normally wrap your bao? Also I find the amount of water/hydration level is pretty important when it comes to wrapping. Doughs that don't have enough water generally are hard to wrap,1
Those are beautiful buns... Mine always come out kind of  funny at the top.,1
Recipe??,1
"Hi r/chinesefood. If you’re anything like me, you  used to either burn your rice into a brick of charcoal or turn it into a  waterlogged mess. I did some research on how to cook rice and found 2  methods that are pretty foolproof and easy to remember/replicate. Made a  video of both methods along with two dishes where rice is a major  component, so that we’re not always eating plain rice. A Crispy Rice  Plate, and Egg Fried Rice.

[Take a look here if you’re interested](https://youtu.be/IOyVWbG1O6o)

**Ingredients:**

**Crispy Rice Plate Ingredients:**

* 2 Cups Cooked Rice
* 1 Cup Water
* Oil

**Directions:**

1. Blend ½ cup of the cooked rice and the 1 cup of water until you get a smooth slurry
2. Preheat a non stick pan, or well oiled pan on medium high heat then pour the slurry in
3. Cook the slurry until bubbly
4. Spread the remaining 1 ½ cup cooked rice on top of the bubbling slurry in an even layer
5. Pour oil around the edge/outside perimeter of the pan
6. Let the rice fry without disturbing or touching it
7. Once  your hear it stop steaming and start crackling AND once the top of the  rice looks dry, put a plate on top of the pan and flip the rice over. It  should come out in one piece with a crispy, crackly top facing up

**Fried Rice Ingredients:**

* 2 Cups Cooked Rice
* 3 Eggs
* 3 Green Onions
* Oil
* 1 Tbsp Soy Sauce
* 1 tsp Sesame Oil (Optional)

**Directions:**

1. Dry out the rice, if it’s fresh cooked, spread it out onto a sheet or plate in a thin layer and let it sit out for 15 mins
2. Slice the green onions, separating the green parts from the white parts
3. In a bowl, crack the eggs and scramble them
4. Preheat a non stick pan, well oiled pan, or Wok on high heat
5. Pour a bit of oil into the pan then turn the heat to low
6. Pour  the scrambled eggs in and with a spatula scrape towards the center of  the pan, starting at 12 o’clock, then 6 o’clock, then 3 o’clock, and  then 9 o’clock
7. Fold up the eggs and cut them up a bit, then take them out of the pan
8. Turn the heat to medium high, pour some more oil into the pan, and dump the white parts of the cut up onions and the rice
9. Using the spatula break up the clumps of rice into small pieces
10. Dump the eggs back in and also break them up into small pieces
11. Pour the soy sauce in the pan and mix the fried rice around to coat it in the soy sauce
12. Repeat step 11 with the sesame oil if using
13. Take it out of the pan and enjoy!

If you try either method or made either dish, let me know. Would love to hear the feedback from you all!",1
Bingo hahaha. I wanted to combine multiple leftovers into one thing 😂,1
When you just throw everything in your fridge into a bao,1
Looks like a college student emptying out his refrigerator ....,1
Good to know! It may be chili oil I’m remembering,1
"hmm i’m from singapore and i’d say it’s just chilli oil here, like kinda like lao gan ma but not crispy and also not so salty

chilli oil is great for many things, but especially in ganlao mian m",1
"For me, I make a super spicy one that I can put on just about anything when I am in the mood for a Sichuan kick, and I make a douchi one for those meals where the dishes aren't ones I like, so then I can just eat a bunch of it on rice and be just as happy. I was told this is why it got popular in China, especially for those who ate in canteens attached to their work/dorms. They could cover up bad-tasting food this way. I think Lao Gan Ma hit the stage at the right time and got the name recognition. I have had several other sauces from that area that I thought were much better, but I think she cornered the market with mass production and a delivery network while others were still local.

I have always wondered when people started calling it chili crisp, I hear that term a lot now but I don't remember it before I moved to China (2004) or when I was in China. I am not sure if it actually refers to all kinds of douchi or chili oils or what but when I make mine there really isn't anything 'crisp'. To me chili crisp just sounds awkward, like when someone says bao instead of baozi.",1
"Sesame prawn toast 

Ingredients 

* 250 grams prawns - deveined and peeled - chopped 
* 1 teaspoon ginger- minced 
* 2 cloves garlic- minced 
* 1 egg white 
* 2 spring onion stalks- chopped 
* 1 1/2 teaspoons light soya sauce 
* 1/4 teaspoon salt 
* 1/4 teaspoon white pepper 
* 4 slices thick white bread 
* 8 tablespoons sesame seeds 
* Vegetable oil - for shallow frying 

Garnish &amp; to Serve 

* Chopped coriander 
* Thai sweet chilli sauce 

Instructions 

1. Place the prawns, ginger, garlic, egg white, green onion, soya sauce, salt and white pepper in a mini food processor.  Process until the mixture resembles a thick paste and is well blended.  
2. Slice the bread into 4 triangles.  Do not remove the crusts from the bread.  
3. Spread around 1 tablespoon of the paste onto each triangle of bread.  Spread evenly.  
4. Place the sesame seeds into a bowl or a shallow plate.  
5. Invert each triangle paste side down into the seeds, until you get a good coating of sesame seeds on each slice of toast.  Place the coated toast pieces onto a plate ready for frying.  
6. Heat some oil in a frying pan, enough to shallow fry.  Check to see if the oil is hot enough by placing a sesame seed in the oil.  If the sesame seed begins to bubble, the oil is ready for frying.  
7. Place 3-4 pieces of toast into the pan, sesame seed side down.  Cook them on one side for 2-3 minutes on a medium heat, then flip and cook one minute longer.  The toast should be golden brown and crispy.  
8. Remove from the oil and blot on kitchen towels.  
9. Serve hot with Thai sweet chilli sauce.  
10. Garnish with the chopped coriander.

"gotta be a better name than chive pockets, although that does seem like the common translation. not criticizing, but 韭菜盒子 sounds so much better. i guess it is just that “pocket” brings to mind hot pockets, and hot pockets are not as nice as what you made. hmmmm. chinese chive and egg fried hezi. hahaha. ill keep thinking.

See comment above.,1
"Hi guys, 
I didn’t quite measure but in general this is how I made them: 
1. Warm water : all purpose flour= 1:2, and knead a couple times into a dough. No need to knead too many times. Rest for 15mins. 
2. Scrambled a couple eggs and then mix in cut fresh chives. Then add in oysters sauce, white pepper and then sesame oil. Add salt at the end. Otherwise the chives will lose some of the juice.
3. Similar to how you would make a dumplings, but make them bigger and flatter. These are pan fried on both sides. Make sure you pinch the edges really tightly so during cooking, the edges do not come apart. I pinched the edges the traditional way but it is not necessary. 

Pan fry until golden brown on both sides. 

Yum yum 🤤

Originally they were made by arranging strands of cold noodles into a sheet on a griddle. Nowadays you can buy manufactured noodle sheets (but you can still separate the strands) without having to painstakingly arrange the noodles.,1
Maybe because it’s cooked by baking dishes 🍳 with special cold noodle 🍜,1
thank you❤️,1
Ok. I'm Chinese-Canadian but I never get this thing. Why is it bbq cold noodle?,1
"Do you mean [velveting the meat](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/velveting-meat) (coating it in corn starch) or [using corn starch to thicken the sauce](https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-use-cornstarch-chinese-cooking/)? Neither is NECESSARY. It's just a technique used to improve the texture of the finished dish. 

I'm not sure that I agree that using a little corn starch is unhealthy, but you'll definitely still have a stir-fry without using corn starch.",1
The reason it says cold noodle is because the noodle is from Korean dish Naengmyeon(냉면冷麵)。There are about two million ethnic Koreans living close to the China-North Korea border.,1

"I guess it’s 湘味小炒鸡 from Hunan. Meanwhile, a lot of places in China can’t resist putting chilli in the dishes.",1
Does it have to be steamed specifically? Non steamed options could be shuizhuyu 水煮鱼 which is boiled or 红烧鱼 hongshaoyu which would be fried and then simmered for a bit but maybe you could make the sauce separately and pour over steamed fish (would be as penetrative in flavour but should still be nice).,1
Apparently comes from Zigong in Sichuan. It's one of the regulars in our weeknight dinners in my family actually.,1
Good luck! Hope you love it as much as I did ❤️,1

"Hi, 
Here is how I made it. About 20 mins total prep plus cooking time. 
Marinate 1/2 lb thinly cut pork with 1 tbsp soy, oyster sauce, sugar, 2 tbsp of balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp of cornstarch for 5 mins or so. 
Stir fry over high heat together 10 slices of thinly sliced ginger (remove skin), one julienne cut carrot, 3 sliced shiitake mushroom, half of a sweet red pepper for 1 min. Then add in the marinaded pork and stir fry together for 3mins or so over high heat. Make sure use enough oil - about 3 tablespoons. At the end, turn of the heat and drizzle about 3 drops of sesame oil. 
Super yummy!

They are—king oyster mushroom is the English name for them. I’ve only ever heard them referred to as chicken leg mushroom in Chinese,1
"Oh wow thanks for that, it was very delicious",1
It has to be one of the most delicious things I have seen that doesn't contain meat.,1

"Hi Lainie, 
I cooked 15 wings today. 
First marinate the wings with 1 teaspoon salt for 20 mins or longer. 
Then coat the wings with 1 teaspoon of oil and then lightly coat them with a little less than 1/4 cup of cornstarch. Shake off any excess cornstarch.
Pan fry them over medium heat covered for 10 mins. Flip every 2 mins and cover the pan in between.
Mix the sauce: Zest from one lemon, juice of 1/2 of the lemon, 2 tbsp honey, 1 tsp sugar and 1/2 tsp dark soy sauce and 1/4 cup of water. 

Mix the sauce and pour on to the wings after they have even pan fried and cook covered over medium low heat until sauce completely thickened. 

If you want to more intense lemon flavor, use zest from 1 and a half lemon. 

Thanks! They are very tasty 😋

Looks so good! Recipe please?,1
"It was great! Those super red American Chinese spare ribs have always been a go-to, and  while I'll still hit up my favorite takeout/delivery, Its great to be able to know I can make it whenever.  All about the marinade/sauce, which is mostly pantry items or condiments with really long shelf lives, so I know that the next time(or 2-3 times) I want it I probably just need to get some pork.  Used sliced pork butt per the recipe suggestion, but country style ribs also have a good meat/fat ratio.",1
Looks great! How was the taste? :9,1
"Tapioca flour and tapioca starch are generally the same thing. [There's also cassava flour, which is similar but different](https://www.spiceography.com/cassava-flour-vs-tapioca-starch/): 

&gt; How does cassava flour differ from tapioca starch?    
&gt; Although manufacturers derive both from a single plant, the process for getting cassava flour differs from that for getting tapioca flour. Cassava flour has a different makeup because of this. Cassava flour is much simpler and made from the whole, white part of the cassava root. The root is dried and finely ground to produce a finely textured gluten-free flour that you can use in many of the same products that might otherwise require wheat flour.

&gt; Tapioca starch is more highly processed as it consists only of the starch from the cassava root isolated from the rest of the root. The root is grated and washed to produce starchy water. That water is evaporated and the white residue that left behind is tapioca starch.  

&gt; Because cassava flour contains the whole root, it has more fiber when compared to tapioca starch. Besides being beneficial for your health, fiber can also improve the texture of some baked goods by acting as a substitute for gluten. Cassava flour has a reputation for being the most similar to wheat flour of all the gluten-free flours.  

&gt; While the flavor of cassava flour is mild, it has a flavor. Cassava flour gives baked goods a subtle nutty flavor. Tapioca starch is like other starches such as corn starch in that it has no flavor.",1

"I love me some good chopped chicken liver.  The Connecticut Duchess fast food chain has a liver and onion sandwich I liked.  But I’ve never really sought out liver. Or organ meats.

I’ve seen Laoganma Brand Lung Sauce in Chinese supermarkets.,1
"Can you put the recipe in full here and not just in YouTube? Just a request, not trying to push",1
If cooked in this way it tastes very good; the pork lung is extremely extremely soft and it almost has no flavor and smell as well (which you get the flavor more from the soup). I don't normally eat organ meat either but this specific one is a special delicacy to me,1
"See Wong Yee in Causeway Bay, HK. My fav siu mei restaurant which unfortunately has already closed its door permanently last year due to the pandemic and all these protests lately",1
I love nearly every organ meat... but lungs... horrible,1
I love their YouTube channel!,1
Indeed 🥳,1
I think it is just a different flavor that certain cultures enjoy and grew up with. My parents love organ meat (chinese immigrants) but I’m not as accustomed to it so I’m not a big fan (american born).,1
What is the allure of lung meat please? Organ meat is not popular in these American states.,1
"I wanted to share this authentic Chinese chilli oil recipe. It’s very aromatic and a bit more subtle than your usual Laoganma.

Recipe by Madewithlau.com,1
"Thee vary so much from city to city and family to family. Softness, sweetness, texture etc. are all up to personal preference so I tried to make this recipe as flexible as possible. The ones we make are kind of a middle of the road between super soft and sweet dim sum ones and the more savoury and slightly denser ones my gran makes but feel free to adjust the sweetness to what you want! 

[Video recipe for the buns here, hopefully the shaping and sealing is easier to see visually as it's a little difficult to describe if you haven't wrapped this kind of filling before!](https://youtu.be/wucs8h0eE50)

Ingredients for the buns:

・250g Flour (use low gluten flour especially for buns from your asian supermarket, cake flour, or if you don't have either you can use plain flour but substituting out 1tbsp of plain flour with corn starch

・3g Yeast

・5g Caster sugar

・3g Baking powder

・140g Water (or milk)

・320g red bean paste (homemade or store bought)

Ingredients for homemade red bean paste

・140g red beans

・40g of sugar as a starter (taste as you go and add up to 100g to adjust to a sweetness you like)

・Pinch of salt

Instructions (to make the buns) :

1. Add sugar and yeast to luke warm water and stir to dissolve.
2. Add the liquids to the flour, add the baking powder and knead until a rough ball forms (i.e. no wet patches of liquid of dry bits of flour remaining) – let the rest for 10-15 minutes so the gluten can relax.
3. Knead until smooth, shiny, and you can run your fingers across the surface of the dough without any cracks forming (roughly 20 minutes) – let this rest for 30 minutes.
4. Knead again to get rid of any large air bubbles (you can cut the dough open to see what it looks like inside, a few small bubble are ok but if there's any ones larger than 1mm than keep kneading). Large air bubbles causes collapse in the buns when they steam and will mean the surface won't stay as smooth and shiny!
5. Portion the red bean paste into 8 40g balls and portion the dough into 8 (roughly 45-50g)
6. Knead each piece until smooth on the outer surface, roll into circles of roughly 12cm diameter, add a ball of red bean paste in the centre of the dough, bring opposite edges together and pinch and then pinch the edges 90 degrees to the first pair together as well. Pinch together all edges where the red bean ball is still exposed. Smoothen parts you've pinched with your fingers and roll the ball on a surface until spherical and smooth.
7. Place on a square of grease proof paper and prove uncovered until they've grown to 1.5x in size and the dough springs back when you press in gently, roughly 30 minutes.
8. Steam on medium high heat for 20 minutes. Turn the heat off after the time and leave in the steamer for 3-5 minutes before opening the lid and taking out to eat! If you work relatively quick you can steam all 8 together. However, if there's more than 30 minutes between making the first 4 and the second 4 buns steam in 2 batches (first 4 first and then second 4) to prevent over proving them. If you over prove them you might end up with a rough exterior. Hope you enjoy them!

To make homemade red bean paste:

1. Soak 140g of dried red beans in cold water for 6-10 hours.
2. Transfer to a pot, cover this with water (around 2 times the height of the red beans) and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer and leave it to cook for 1.5-2 hours, or until when you apply a bit of pressure to the beans they are able to be crushed very easily.
3. Transfer to a blender and blend until the colour is homogenous (no darker bits of skin remaining) and the paste is completely smooth.
4. Transfer to a non-stick sauce pan and add the sugar\* and salt and start stirring. You want to cook out the moisture until it feels solid and is firm enough to be able to be folded and packed on top of it self. It will weigh 350-400g when it's done.
5. Seal the paste immediately and pop in the fridge. It's ready to use when it's cool :)

\*start with adding 40g of sugar and then taste it, then add more (up to 100g of sugar) until it's at a sweetness that's yummy for you. Remember the paste is going into a bun so the sweetness you will actually taste when you're eating the bun will be around 1/2 the sweetness your tasting when you eat the plain red bean paste so keep that in mind! A little bit too sweet will probably be just right in the actual bun.",1

"Today, we are making Liang Mian Huang (两面黄).  Huang (黄) means golden brown. Liang Mian (两面) means double-sided. The name describes the look of this dish because the noodles are pan-fried on both sides until golden brown. It is like a CRUNCHY version of Chow Mein and topped with a saucy vegetable and protein stir fry. Super delicious and let’s get started.

If you want to know more details, here is the full video： [https://youtu.be/3F\_ynlB6sfw](https://youtu.be/3F_ynlB6sfw)

&amp;#x200B;

\* 1/3 tsp of paprika

\* 2 tsp of Chinese cooking wine

\* Black pepper to taste

\* 1/2 tbsp of olive oil to saute the seafood

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*For the Vegetables Stir Fry\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\* 1 tsp of olive oil

\* 113 grams 4 oz of carrot, sliced

\* 113 grams 4 oz of celery, sliced

\* 98 grams 3.5 oz of mushroom, sliced

\* 1 tbsp of oyster sauce

\* 1 tbsp of soy sauce

\* 2 cups of water

\* 2.5 tbsp of water + 2.5 tbsp of cornstarch

\* Salt to taste

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*INSTRUCTIONS\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*1.  Choose your noodles\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Egg noodle is what we normally use for this recipe.  Let me show you some options that you find on the markets (Click this link to see the picture of different kinds of noodles - [https://imgur.com/a/3G8oo0V](https://imgur.com/a/3G8oo0V))

&amp;#x200B;

\* HK-style pan-fried noodles (港式熟炒面): they also have the Chinese name (两面黄) on the package. It is funny, in China, this dish is popular in Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Hongkong, but I don’t know why they only credit HK. However, these are halfway cooked already, so you don’t need to pre-boil them; just season them by taste and then panfry them.

\* Fresh egg noodles (全蛋云吞面): also known as wonton noodles, which you can find it in the fridge or frozen section at your local Asian grocery stores. You can also click this link and learn how to make it at home - [https://youtu.be/r8QEqwNBSbQ](https://youtu.be/r8QEqwNBSbQ)

\* Pre-packed dried egg noodles (鸡蛋面): This should be easier to find. I have seen them in regular non-Asian supermarkets. Just pay attention to the noodle aisle, you will find them.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*2.  Pre-cook the noodles\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\* For both fresh and dried egg noodles, you will have to pre-boil them until they are halfway cooked. Today, I will be using the fresh noodle as an example.

\* Bring 3 liters of water to a boil and add the fresh egg noodles in. Stir for 20-40 seconds depends on the thickness. If you are using the dried form, it will take much longer.

\* Take them out and drain them completely. Rinse them with cold water to stop the cooking process. Make sure to shake off the excess water.

\* Season it with 1/2 tsp of sugar, 1/2 tbsp of soy sauce, 1/2 tbsp of oyster sauce, 1 drizzle of olive oil. Mix it well.

\* This recipe is enough for 2-3 people, so you can divide the noodles into however many portions you decide to serve. I am going to split it in half. Set them aside.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*3. Prepare the seafood and vegetables\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\* Season 140 grams of peeled and deveined shrimp and 140 grams of sea scallop with 1/3 tsp of salt, 1/3 tsp of paprika, 2 tsp of Chinese cooking wine, one drizzle of olive oil, and some black pepper to taste. Mix it well and set it aside for 10 minutes.

\* During this time, we can prepare our vegetables. This is a great opportunity for you to clean out your fridge because you can use whatever vegetables you have. I chose carrot, celery, mushrooms, and snow peas. The only thing you want to be aware of is to cut the vegetables into almost the same size so they can be cooked evenly.

\* Besides that, slice three cloves of garlic and 1/2 inch of ginger thinly. Set them aside, and we are ready to cook.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*4. Pan-fried the noodles\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\* I am using my carbon steel wok to cook the noodles. I am sure a lot of you have had terrible experiences with noodles sticking to the wok. The trick to prevent that is to heat the wok until it is smoking hot. I do have a wok 101 video that explains the sciences, so if you want to know why it works you can click here to check out that video. When the wok is properly heated, add about 3 tbsp of oil and toss it around to create a non-stick layer.

\* Switch the heat to medium and add the noodles. Don’t stir them immediately. Let one side to fry for a minute or 2. At the same time, use chopsticks to fluff the noodles a little bit because we don’t want them to be compacted into a hard, chewy pancake. We want it to be light and airy.

\* Shake your wok, and the noodles should naturally release from the wok surface. Flip the noodles over and cook the other side. At this moment, the noodles are not golden yet. That is ok, you just flip the noodles every 2-3 minutes. It will take about 10-12 minutes in total to get them golden and crispy.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Note: the center of the noodles is not as crispy as the side. That is because my stove only has 1 circle of flame. The heat is uneven. It is totally fine for this recipe because we will pour the soupy stir fry right over the center to cover that spot.\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*5. Stir fry the seafood and vegetables\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\* Next, we will cook our seafood. Turn the heat back on high. Add a little more oil - about 1/2 tbsp. Go in with the seafood. As I mentioned my stove heat is uneven, so I placed them in a ring to avoid that low heat center. Flip them over. If your wok is hot enough, each side only needs 20 seconds. It is best to undercook them because we will cook them again later on. If they are fully cooked now, they will be overcooked when you mix them with vegetables. Set the seafood aside.

\* Add another tsp of oil and we will cook the vegetables. Turn the heat on low. Toss in the garlic and ginger slices. Stir for a minute or until they are fragrant. Throw in all the vegetables. Cook them for a couple of minutes or until they are a bit soft. Season with 1 tbsp of soy sauce and 1 tbsp of oyster sauce. Mix until the flavor is well combined. Pour in 2 cups of water. Bring this to a boil.

\* Turn the heat to low. Introduce the seafood back to the wok. Add in some cornstarch water in batches (2.5 tbsp of water + 2.5 tbsp of cornstarch). Stir it at the same time. Once the soup is thickened up. Give it a taste to adjust the flavor.

Serve this soupy stir fry on top of the crispy noodles. The idea of this recipe is that some of the noodles will absorb the sauce and become tender and savory while the other part of the noodles stays crispy. That way",1

"IMPOSSIBLE Mapo Tofu l How To Make Mapo Tofu With Impossible Meat (or Pork or Beef)

Full Video Recipe:

https://youtu.be/bl6EcC7FGgw

I challenged myself to make the mapo tofu with impossible meat an the end results were very satisfiying! Learn how to make chinese mapo tofu from scratch with me in this step by step guide where I break down the ins and outs of this classic Szechuan (also spelt Sichuan) recipe.  This simple mapo tofu recipe is packed full of flavour is one of the best things you can have with rice. Be warned, it is a spicy dish so get ready for the burn. 

As mentioned in the video, the traditional authentic versions of mapo tofu would use beef or pork but I have opted to use Impossible Meat because of the challenge (and to keep this recipe fully vegan for my vegan and vegetarian friends). I must however say that the Impossible Meat tasted a lot like lean beef and I couldn’t really tell the difference when I had it with the spicy mapo tofu. Do of course do what makes you happy and use whichever mince meat you prefer. 

You will need:

300g of Soft Tofu

50g Impossible Meat

3 cloves of minced Garlic

1 to 1.5 tbsp Spicy Szechuan Bean Paste (Dou Ban Jiang) – (Tip: Be sure to taste as you go along as I found that different brands of Dou Ban Jiang have vastly different amounts of salt)

0.5 tbsp Fermented Black Beans

0.5 tsp Chilli Powder

0.5 tbsp Szechuan Peppercorns

5 dried Shitake Mushrooms

1 to 1.25 cups of Mushroom Stock (made from re-hydrating the shitake mushrooms)

1 tsp soy sauce (if needed, this will depend on how salty your Dou Ban Jiang is)

1 to 1.5 tsp Shaoxing Wine

1 to 1.5  tsp Sugar

0.5 tbsp Cornstarch (mixed with 1 tbsp spoon of Water to make a slurry)

Steps:

Place your shitake mushrooms in a pot of water with about 2 cups of water and simmer for 10 minutes till the mushrooms are tender. Once done, take the mushrooms out of the pot and slice into cubes once cooled. Reserve the leftover mushroom stock for later.

Toast the Szechuan peppercorns over medium-low heat for 2-3 minutes until aromatic. Toss/stir the Szechuan peppercorns to ensure that they don’t burn. Grind the toasted Szechuan peppercorns in a pestle and mortar.

Cut your tofu into cubes and simmer in a pot of lightly salted water. This helps firm up the tofu and applies a gentle and even layer of seasoning on the tofu. It also helps to remove the “raw” smell of the tofu that while not unpleasant, is not ideal for mapo tofu.

 

Fry your impossible meat (or minced meat) over medium heat until slightly browned. Next add the shitake mushrooms and minced garlic that we prepared earlier and fry for another minute or so. Next add the spicy Szechuan bean paste (dou ban jiang), fermented black beans, chilli powder and fry for another 2 – 3 minutes to allow the flavours to intensify. 

Add 1 cup of mushroom stock, shaoxing cooking wine and sugar and simmer. Taste your sauce at this point, if the sauce is well seasoned, don’t add any salt/soy sauce to it. If the sauce is under salted, you can add some soy sauce (but taste as you go along because depending on the brand of dou ban jiang you use the sodium levels can really differ for everyone).

Next drain your tofu that was prepared earlier and add it into the wok. Gently push it around with the back of your ladle so you don’t end up breaking it apart. 

After about 3-4 minutes, add your cornstarch slurry. Give the wok a good stir and once the sauce thickens, turn off the heat and transfer the mapo tofu into a bowl. Sprinkle your toasted and ground Szechuan peppercorns and serve with rice.",1

"As a Chinese person, I think Japanese ramen as a Japanese Chinese dish, a dish invented by Chinese people base on some existing Chinese dish &amp; inspirations, but originated outside of China. I think some other dishes like Tangsuyuk/탕수육 from Korea, Orange Chicken in the US, Lomo Saltado from Peru, and Hainan Chicken/海南鸡 from Singapore, and many many more! The food born in these countries &amp; regions should be considered Chinese food as much as other regional Chinese cuisines. But this is only my opinion, a view that’s tends to be more inclusive, there are also many who disagree and believe in a more narrow/strict definition.",1

I feel like you could actually do that! Best way to find out is just to experiment!,1
Sadly no. I live in an area with real winters. The Asian store here although not a big chain like 99 Ranch Market is actually pretty good and they get some amazingly fresh produce.,1
Or you live in a very warm place,1
Amazing. Probably grown in a green house,1
It was available at my local Asian grocery store a few months back. I usually cut it up and freeze into portions so I can have it for a while. This portion was made about 2 weeks ago.,1
"Winter melon of 2021 has not come into being. Is this melon from 2020, 10 months ago? Even pumpkin doesn't last this long",1
" Apparently, winter melon stores very well and can last for months after being harvested.",1

This is not yet winter melon season,1
Looks delish,1
"I love dry fried green beans, now you have me wondering if I can make the recipe with asparagus which has just come into season and is very cheap where I live.",1
"Here I'm so basically there are two approcces: 

1) you make a concentrated base than dilute with simple stock or water;
2) you make the stock already diluted, that's my approach. 

For reference I made a simple stock and added beef chuck, when was tender I picked up drained and put in the fridge for easier slicing. 

This is for 1 bowl, so feel free to multiply if you want more. 

Ingredients for the soup: 300g of stock, 100g of beef, 1tbs each of neutral oil, chili oil, doubanjiang, light soy sauce and wine, 1 clove of garlic and a piece of ginger (I use it whole than remove it both garlic and ginger), some form of onion (I used the white part of a green onion), sugar, salt and dark soy sauce are up to you, plus the aromatic mix: 3 cloves, 1 star anise, 1 cardamom pod, 1 cinnamon stick and 1 tsp of Sichuan peppercorn and coriander seeds. I suggest you to put the spices into a tea bag or something and toast them before putting them in.  You can easily pick them out and have maximum flavor. 

Noodles: I used 125g of fresh tagliatelle, but feel free to use asian noodles, I use fresh egg pasta cause here in Italy is really really cheap. 

Toppings: green part of a green onion, parsley (I hate raw coriander it's like soap for me), bock choy, sesame seeds and sesame oil. 

So put oil, chili oil, onion, garlic and ginger in a wok and fry for a while (I fish the ginger and garlic out cause I don't want to eat them but feel free to let them be in the pot), then add the beef and doubanjiang (be quick this stuff burns easily). Deglaze the pot with wine and soy sauce, add the stock and aromatic mix. Now is up to you add salt and sugar until you like the taste and adjust the color with dark soy sauce. Boil it down not too long actually cause you have a solid base in the stock.",1

And for me?,1
Classic hotpot soup too! Yum,1
"A Sichuan classic ‘’Gan Bian Si Ji Dou (干煸四季豆)’’ which translates to dry-fried green beans. This dish is made from dry frying green beans in sichuan peppercorns, garlic, ginger, soy sauce and minced pork and it has a bit of that recognisable Sichuan spicy numbing flavor (麻辣). It is a perfect dish to accompany other stronger tasting dishes and it’s very simple to make and quite healthy which makes this a must-try!

Also we did a little experiment and compared frying these beans with and without oil so if you are interested in that you can check that out as well

"Hi r/chinesefood.  Made some dumplings using a recipe my   Grandma and Dad gave me for authentic dumplings made exactly like they   do in China. It takes awhile, but it makes A TON of dumplings that   easily serves 6 - 8 people. Or you can freeze them and reheat when   needed.

[Step by Step Instructions Here](https://youtu.be/knVNnD4SqOs)

**Ingredients:**

* Dough:  

   * 6 Cups of Flour
   * 1 ⅔ Cup Lukewarm Water
* Filling:  

   * 2 lbs Ground Pork
   * 4 - 5 Napa Cabbage Leaves
   * 1 Tbsp Minced Ginger
   * 4 Spring Onions, Minced
   * 1 Tbsp Salt
   * ⅓ Cup Water
   * ¼ Cup Soy Sauce
   * 1 tsp Sesame Oil

**Directions:**

Dough

1. Add the Flour and lukewarm water in a bowl.
2. Knead it into a shaggy dough
3. Turn   it out onto a lightly floured counter and knead for 5 - 10 mins or   until not sticking to you or the table. The motion is to PUSH the dough,   then pull back. Not just press into the dough
4. Set it aside, covered, while preparing the filling

Filling

1. Chop up the Napa cabbage leaves into a fine mince, then set in a bowl and salt it. Let it sit while the prep the rest
2. Mince up the ginger and green onions then set aside
3. Add   ground pork to a bowl and add the salt, water, and soy sauce in small   additions while stirring in one direction (I chose clockwise) - this   will develop a better protein matrix that stays juicier as it cooks.
4. Add the ginger, scallions, and sesame oil and stir again
5. Wring the cabbage out dry - it should release a shocking amount of water. Then add the cabbage to the pork and stir

Assembly

1. Rip a chunk of dough off and lightly knead it into a flat disk
2. Then poke a hole in the center and working your hands around the doughnut shape, stretch out the circumference of the dough
3. Rip the dough at a point, then roll it into a log about the diameter of an adult thumb
4. Cut or rip pieces off the dough log the size of half and adult thumb
5. Roll those pieces into balls, then smash flat to make small disks
6. Using   a rolling pin, roll from the edge of the disk to the center then   slightly rotate and repeat, making sure to leave the center thicker than   the edges. This will allow more filling to be put in the dumpling.   Repeat this till the disk is \~3in/7.5cm
7. Put a Tbsp of the filling in the center of the dough
8. Press it down to remove air pockets
9. Take the opposite ends of the dough and fold them together, Pinch em to form a seem.
10. Using your thumb and base of your index finger, crimp/seal the edges to form the dumpling.
11. Repeat steps 1 - 6, THEN steps 7 - 10 in batches. Doing all the dough at once will dry it out before you can fill all the disks

Cooking

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil
2. Stir it to form a current/whirlpool
3. Drop the dumplings into the whirlpool
4. Cover and lower the heat to medium
5. Once the water starts boiling again, add some cool water and gently stir to form another whirlpool
6. Cover the repeat step 5 two more times, or until the meat registers 165F
7. Using a slotted spoon, remove the cooked dumplings from the pot and plate em up

That's   it! Again, it does take some time and is best done with others. But   this recipe makes a truly staggering amount of dumplings that last for   multiple meals.

I hope you make it and let me know how it goes!",1
"A classic Sichuan dish, cheap and simple yet delicious! Its basically spicy savory glass noodle with ground pork. The meaning of this dish is quite interesting as it's named ''Ants climbing a tree''. Because the noodles represent the branches, the ground pork represents the ants and the spring onions represent the leaves.

[3 min Video recipe + Tastetest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wig_BaXyq-w&amp;t=44s)

🌶️Ingredients:
110g dry vermicelli/glass noodles
1 tablespoon oil
1 tablespoon ginger 
2 cloves of garlic
1 tablespoon spicy fermented bean sauce/paste
150 ground pork (can substitute ground chicken)
2 teaspoons chicken powder
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon dark soy sauce 
2 teaspoons light soy sauce 
1 spring onion

🌶️Instructions:
1. Soak the dry noodles in cold water for 10 minutes. Rinse, drain and set aside. In a wok over medium heat, add the oil and minced ginger. Cook the ginger for about a minute, and add the spicy bean sauce. Let that cook for another minute, and then add the ground pork (or chicken). Stir-fry until the meat is cooked through.

2. Add the chicken stock, sugar, dark soy sauce, and light soy sauce. Bring everything to boil. Once boiling, add the glass noodles and scallions. Quickly stir everything together for 1-2 minutes. Serve alone, or with steamed rice!",1

Yes homemade everything haha,1
Yes wonton are all homemade and the soup was made with 1 whole chicken,1
This looks so lovely. I have actually never made wonton soup before. Did you make the wontons yourself as well?

"In China, ""ramen"" (""lamian"" 拉面) generally refers to how the noodles are made -- pulled noodles. Most folk will probably associate it with [Lanzhou-style pulled noodles](https://youtu.be/QHmfXN2s-pA). Japanese-style ramen (which are based on Chinese-style lamian ) traditionally were hand-pulled, but usually it's [made by machine](https://youtu.be/Ijem5TH51j0).  

The soup base is quite different these days. Originally the Japanese ramen soup would have been more like the light pork broths of Cantonese and Shanghainese soup noodles; these days they are still pork tend to be richer and more aromatic, at times thicker, sometimes with the addition of fish/seaweed. Chinese lamian soups generally have a clear broth from either beef, lamb, or pork depending on the region. 

The toppings, though, are what made this one clearly Japanese to me. Eggs generally aren't added, and if they are, they aren't boiled or steamed eggs but fried eggs. (though TBH thanks to the popularity of Japanese-style ramen you'll find places which have the boiled egg.) Seaweed isn't often added, but when it is, it's the shredded laver added to the soup rather than the pressed sheets added atop. Usually one would expect coriander and/or scallions/green onions and perhaps radish and chilis. And that cut of pork is very much Japanese.

"We usually don’t cut our meat like that in our noodle soup, and I’ve personally never seen noodles quite like that in Chinese cuisine. However, there’s a ton of subcultures within Chinese cuisine so maybe something like this exists elsewhere that I’ve just never seen before.",1
Looks tasty. I love having a lot of broth.,1

The game changer was actually following the recipe and adding a water bath: prior to this recipe I always ignored instructions to use a water bath—how could adding water possibly facilitate crispy skin, especially after you spend so much time drying out the skin?

My thoroughly unscientific conclusion is that the steam in the oven helps fat in the skin render before it starts to dry out from the heat of the oven. Now that I think about it, I always add a splash of water when rendering fat from pancetta because it helps keep things from drying out and browning too quickly rather than continuously releasing liquid fat.

Also, Jun instructs you to skewer the meat, helping keep that pork skin surface flat while the protein shrinks in the heat. More even surface to brown and puff up that skin.",1

Recipes I recommend from that book:
Mapo Tofu
Fish Fragrant Eggplant (Aubergines)
Dan Dan Noodles
Chef Chen Dailu’s Spicy Sesame Noodles
Sour Hot Silken Tofu
Stir fried potato slivers with Sichuan pepper and chiles
Hangzou  Breakfast  Noodles (This is the only non-Sichuan recommendation here)

"Ngiu Chap is a signature beef and noodle soup found mainly in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. The name is the Hakka pronunciation for “mixed beef”. The name comes from the mixture of different beef parts that come with the soup, mostly sliced beef, beef balls, beef brisket, beef tendon, beef tripe, beef tongue and more. Ngiu Chap is likely to be created by Chinese immigrants coming from Hainan Island. Hainanese people are well-known in using all parts of animals in their cuisines.

Ngiu Chap’s soup is traditionally made from beef broth which has been cooked with beef bones, simmered for hours with white radishes, various spices and aromatic herbs. The resulting soup is very fragrant and full of beefy flavours, while still being light and not greasy.

Ngiu Chap is served with different types of noodles. It can be egg noddles, vermicelli, flat rice noodles or even silver needle noodles. The noodles can be served in the beef soup, or be tossed in soy sauce in a separate bowl.

Nowadays, Ngiu Chap has many different variations, from the lighter Hainanese style to heartier Hakka-influenced flavours, and even village-style adapted for indigenous Sabahan palate. There are also experimental flavour combination like Laksa-based Ngiu Chap.",1

"Hi, It is very similar to a crepe except much thinner and the eggs are put on top instead of mixing in with the flour. Traditionally, mung bean flour is used instead of the regular wheat flour.

[https://thewoksoflife.com/sichuan-dry-fried-green-beans/](https://thewoksoflife.com/sichuan-dry-fried-green-beans/)

You could also use it in recipes that call for zha cai. It's not exactly the same, but the result should still be tasty.",1
I used to split a cow with my friend and we love grilled beef heart. Don't know any Chinesef recipe for beef heart. Good luck!,1
"The traditional Pan Mee is most commonly served either in soup or slicked in soy sauce. However, in 1985, all this changed.

One man created a version of Pan Mee that would spearhead the trend of Pan Mee from that point onwards – the Dry Chilli Pan Mee. Tan Kok Hong, 70-year-old owner of the legendary Restoran Kin Kin in KL, is responsible for reinventing the dish while testing Malaysians’ threshold of heat.

The white noodle is rolled out like regular Pan Mee, but made thinner and rounder like spaghetti. The noodles are chucked into a plastic bowl, and topped with a poached egg, anchovies, minced pork and green onions. Chili paste is scooped onto the noodles and everything is tossed everything together so the chili and egg coats every strand. The result is a fiery punch in the gut, a thoroughly heart-stopping combination of ingredients that awakens the senses. The fiery noodle is often accompanied with a small bowl of sayur manis soup for soothing the spiciness.

The dish became so popular that other shops in Klang Valley started to replicate Dry Chilli Pan Mee, which further spreads its glory throughout Malaysia.",1
Didn't know you could. Thanks,1
Stir fry diced chicken and mixed pepper~,1
"Yeah, it is very yummy!",1
My kids don’t eat spicy food. I am sure they will like it when they are older. So I just used regular soy bean paste 大酱instead the spicy dobanjiang豆瓣酱version.,1
Doesn’t the spicy come from do ban jeong? How do you make it not spicy?,1
My parents make them exactly like this...so delicious I’m sure!!!,1
You can probably stir fry it with some minced pork.,1
I put it in my fried rice.  Also Ji dan bing.,1
Suan cai yu is delicious.,1
This looks amazing!,1
Making this right now ! Thanks for the new recipe,1
"I made just one portion but easy easy 100g of high gluten flour (I use panettone flour) 50g of beaten egg (1 whole egg in my case) and a gram of salt. Mix, put half an hour in a plastic bag, then roll them out with a pasta machine at setting 4.",1
Wow how’d you make those noodles?,1

Recipe please. Looks delish.,1
"Wow, I haven’t seen this set up before? From the color of the beef I am guessing it’s Chaoshan style beef hot pot/潮汕牛肉火锅？",1
"I agree that nanru is a fantastic alternative for coloring, another one I would recommend is LaoChou/老抽, it’s a much darker soy sauce often used for coloring! (Also, did you had a problem with making 糖色/TangSe/caramel color? Bc I recently found out that the type of sugar one uses has a huge effect on the color and sweet/bitter-ness of the TangSe.)",1
"In the end I had to use nanru in order to get the red color. Using sugar only was not satisfying enough, and I was reluctant to add more sugar to get the color because the flavor will be unbalanced. 

Nanru is an exellent choice here.",1

"I really liked my evening strolls down there when I was passing through. Cumin lamb skewers, seeing the hanging lambs being butchered, and the wonderful flatbreads and rolled ice cream...

It's more like a vegetable party！,1
Np! Glad it helps.😊😊,1
Thank you! This is super helpful and I will try to make it soon. I love wontons!,1
"1. You can use either water or chicken broth, chicken broth will taste better.  Add a bit salt and pepper, if you want the color to look better,  you can also add few drops of soy sauce.
2. Same way to prepare for the scrambled egg, but don’t move/touch the egg once they are in the pan until it is a nice hard thin layer. Slice it after take out.
3. Seaweed or you could call it nori I guess?
4. Zha cai.   You can get it in any Asian grocery store. It will give extra salty and umami taste in the soup.
5. And last add the cooked wontons either by boiled or steamed.
6. You can also add some chicken strips if you like.",1
I want egg tarts!!! Either this or Portuguese/Macau egg tarts!!,1
Look so good! How did you make the broth? Any recipe/ingredients to share?,1
I suck at plating.. but who cares as long as it's delicious..,1
It's food wars!,1
Sounds very good!,1
Nice.  I’m planning to do pork and chives.,1
"I used this recipe:
https://thewoksoflife.com/lions-head-meatballs/

I would have just followed the version of the wonderful Souped Up Recipes account on youtube, but she used a clay pot, I don't have a clay pot, and I was feeling a little lazy.",1
I used pork and bok choy.,1
Looks unauthentic,1
They look great.   What filling did you use?,1
Oh you know it's already in there ;),1
"They were delicious! I could have chopped up the water chestnuts I added into the meat a little finer, and maybe picked a slightly fattier cut of meat (I used pork shoulder instead of belly, as a good selection on pork belly is not common where I live), but overall I'm very happy with it.",1

Looks goood!,1
Using which of the ingredients?,1
Looks good!!,1
Who cares about plating? These look great! Were they tasty?,1
Actually really damn good. The vinegar was the missing component! The one thing missing was whatever pickled vegetable they toss in with the bean sprouts and chilli oil on top.  (I’ve never been able to identify it- maybe dakon?),1
How did it turn out?!,1
"This is LaoShang Green Tea from ShangDong Province, which didn’t really produce tea until the 1950s from a project call 南茶北引/import southern tea to the north, and this green tea from Lao mountain (down slop 3 side facing water/ocean) was one of the first successful breed that grow there! If you like this style of tea, I recommend you try 沂蒙绿茶/YiMeng green tea, grown in central ShangDong’s mountains forests surrounded by rivers, similar profile with a very unique aroma!",1
"I think this is 螺蛳粉/LuoSiFeng from Guangxi! LuoSi is a type of water snail, kinda like escargot! This dish has became popular in China in recent year due to its… funky aroma (some would call stinky), which comes from the fermented bamboo shoots! You can find instant ones in most Chinese/East Asian markets, but a little reminder, you might not want to heat it in your microwave &amp; enjoy this in a well ventilated area!",1
"I think the translation is a bit off, 回民/Hui ppl are just one of many ethnic minority groups in China that have a majority believe in Islam/are Muslims, however they are one of the largest and most widely settled, living in almost every city around the country!

Don’t forget to add MSG! For the noms,1
It looks tasty😋😋😋,1
Hi there! I’d say it’s an acquired taste. I eat it because u will be lucky for the year! :) A combi of sweet and tangy sauces mixed with many shredded veges etc. Which country do u live in? I hope u have a chance to try!,1

"I haven't been to either of these restaurants, but the closet recipe to my local Sichuan place is [this recipe](https://omnivorescookbook.com/szechuan-dry-fried-green-beans/) without the ground pork. The secret ingredient I was missing when trying to replicate it was pickled mustard.",1
Thanks!!,1
"I'll echo the other person, I would suggest adding some sugar and rice vinegar. I would also suggest adding ginger.

&amp;#x200B;

The recipe I've found I like a lot includes all those things you list plus some extra stuff. The base of the recipe I follow is here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf5mCqVmr28&amp;list=PL1XxTCLsxCd\_HQ1ZEwkRlGEeVnC5UPGsK&amp;index=24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf5mCqVmr28&amp;list=PL1XxTCLsxCd_HQ1ZEwkRlGEeVnC5UPGsK&amp;index=24)

But in addition to that guy's recipe, I also add 1/2 tsp sesame oil, 1/2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp MSG, tablespoon of chili oil (I love Lee Yum Kee Chiu Chow Chili oil), 1/2 tsp white pepper powder, and some ground cayenne pepper and Sichuan peppercorns. I also tend to be a bit generous with the chili oil, garlic, and peanut butter (because I like them :P). You could also play around with how you prepare your garlic (I grate on a micro plane), since that can impact the intensity of the garlicky flavor. Julienned cucumbers are also nice. Sometimes I'll also some diced chicken (that was marinated in soy sauce and other stuff before cooking).

&amp;#x200B;

I've also found the type of noodle can make quite a difference. I really like soba noodles or some fresh alkaline noodles. In contrast, I've tried with spaghetti, but did not like it as much.

&amp;#x200B;

But as much as I love the recipe I've settled on here, I'll admit it is not *quite* as good as what I could get from this Chinese place near where I used to work... I loved that stuff.",1
Looks fantastic,1
Yum!! Nice.,1
"Hahah, doing the research! Lemme know what batter ya end up going with.",1
I just finished with my first attempt and I am already so close! I got the batter just right. And the seasoning is so close. I out wayyy too much sichuan peppercorn in it 😂,1
Please do!,1
Thank you. I’m going to try it tonight!,1
Thanks so much! Definitely worth the trip. I'm in utah now and the selection of authentic chinese food is so slim :/,1
When you’re missing Chengdu food so much you start recreating everything at home 😅😅,1
"I didn't want to be political on a sub devoted to food, but I had the same thought. The touristy, Disney-fied nature of this doesn't sit right when the Chinese Government is, once again, exterminating people. It's not like Tibet was that long ago.",1
"Ok, will do! We have a couple of very good, authentic (less Americanized) Chinese places in the triad; Hometown Delicious (Greensboro, Market St) and Gourmet China (Greensboro, Brassfield shopping center off Battleground). Also in Winston Salem - New Sichuan on Silas Creek Pkwy. :) I have no qualms about traveling for good food, so if I go to Taipei 101 I’ll ask about the green beans! :)",1
It's gonna be a tricky one to recreate but I've got some ideas. I'll definitely post here once I get it!,1
Ahh I never got around to going to that restaurant! I lived in Chapel Hill for almost a year and never went :( thanks for the tip,1
Thank you so much!!,1
It's pretty similar to salt and pepper fish and that's gonna be the baseline recipe I try first!,1
If you go I have a favor to ask of you! They're both in the Cary area. The first is Taipei 101 which is my all time favorite place. You need to try the GanGuoJi (skillet chicken) and the dry fried green beans. They are to die for. And the other place is Sichuan Taste. If you go to Taipei 101 I need you to ask what's in the green beans 😂,1
Aww man. Thanks anyway,1
I didn't! I'm vegetarian... Sorry lol,1
"Most important thing is probably what ratio of those ingredients you are using, especially peanut butter vs tahini vs sesame oil. Should be mostly peanut butter.  

I use regular soy instead of sweet soy, no scallion or cilantro (can add after if you like, along with julienne carrots and cucumbers). 

Missing is rice vinegar.

This is pretty close to what I do, exception being I don't use orange juice and do add honey or just straight sugar (about 1/2 tablespoon is about right if using the amounts of other ingredients in this recipe): [https://thewoksoflife.com/cold-sesame-noodles/](https://thewoksoflife.com/cold-sesame-noodles/)",1

"Flavors are great, texture is, you know, like shirataki noodles. No complaints tho.",1
"Yeah, u/saamenerve said it. These were tofu noodles and pack about twice as much calories. I also used starch in the sauce to coat the noodles better. I find these to be have a better mouth feel than yam shirataki but it could totally be just me.",1
I agree too. Looks like 椒盐鱼片 (Jiao yan yu pian) I always ate this style with squid or pork chops as a kid.,1
What restaurants in NC? I’d love to try this! :),1
"So the noodles have a jelly cup like texture and don’t absorb much flavor. I used some starch in the sauce so it’s coated better. If you ask me and I had to answer honestly — no I don’t think it compares with real wheat noodles or rice sticks, but it’s a life saver when you are watching your calories.",1
How was it tho??,1
What kind of mushrooms are those in the last pic?,1
"I agree, I think it's definitely salt and pepper fish.",1
"I've had that before, I feel like the secret is in the batter. I've tried recreating it with different combinations of flour, corn starch, sweet potato flour, but haven't been able to recreate it.",1

"I like the sound of the tofu blend, more protein, so longer lasting appetite satiation.",1
"Could be just the lightening, but I have also heard about some type of shirataki noodles containing tofu, apparently it is more reminiscent of actual noodles but it's got slightly more calories",1
Gourmet kingdom in Carrboro NC calls it Szechuan spicy fish 香辣鱼,1
"I might be wrong, but I don’t think that’s a specific named dish. It looks like a twice cooked fish using standard Sichuan flavors. If you Google “Sichuan twice cooked fish” you end up with this, which looks great but isn’t quite what you want: https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/twice-cooked-fish/

Basically, you probably want to do that dish but instead of black beans and fresh chilies, use Sichuan peppercorn and dried chilies. 

Another angle would be “Kung pao fish” without peanuts. That gets you this: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/06/kung-pao-fish-dried-chilies-sichuan-peppercorns-recipe.html

When I read the ingredients and recipe I think that’s pretty close to what you want, although the picture doesn’t look quite right. It may be more a matter of the shape the fish was sliced into. 

A YouTube search finds this, which looks pretty close to what you’re looking for:

"Steamed branzino: Ask your fishmonger to descale and clean the fish

Ingredients:

\- 2 tbsp soy sauce

\- Salt

\- 2 tbsp Shaoxing wine (or any rice cooking wine)

\- 4 inch knob of fresh ginger, half sliced into pieces and half into thin slivers

\- 4 cloves of garlic, smashed

\- A couple of green onions (separate the white part from the green part. Finely dice the green part, and you can leave the white part whole)

\- chili crisps or chili oil (you can also use pickled/fermented chopped red chili if you can find it in store)

&amp;#x200B;

Steps:

\- Rinse the fish in running water, and then pat dry

\- Use a knife to make 3-4 diagonal cuts into the thickest part of each side of the fish, so that seasoning can penetrate

\- Sprinkle some salt on both sides and the inside of fish and be sure to rub some salt into the cuts you made. If you use fine sea salt or table salt, use less, but you can be more liberal if you use coarse salt.

\- Place fish on a plate that is large enough (be sure to use a plate that can fit into whatever pot/wok you will be using for steaming. I used a wok that has a domed lid (if you don't have any pot that's large enough, you will need to chop the fish into half).

\- Drizzle shaoxing wine and soy sauce on fish, and be sure to rub the inside of fish with the wine and soy sauce as well

\- Stuff ginger slices, garlic, and the white part of green onions inside the fish

\- Place ginger slivers on top of the fish, and then sprinkle some chili crisps or oil over fish.

\- Let the fish sit on the counter for 30 min if possible so that more flavor will get into the fish 

\- Once you are ready to steam the fish, bring a pot of water to a boil, and place the plate of fish into the pot and cover. Steam for 12-15 minutes - depending on how large the fish is. I have an instant read kitchen thermometer, so I  use it to temp the interior of the fish for doneness (Usually 165F+ is sufficient)

\- Once done, you can drizzle some Sichuan peppercorn oil or sesame oil on top, and sprinkle the finely diced green onion. IF you want to be extra fancy,  instead of drizzling cold oil, heat up some neutral oil in another pan, and pour the hot oil over the fish (after you've sprinkled the finely diced green onion). 

&amp;#x200B;

Water spinach

Ingredients: 

\- Water spinach (I typically separate the leafy part from the stem-y part, and only stir fry the leafy part, and use the stem-y part for another dish, because the leafy part cooks much more quickly) - I can't give you an amount because I usually don't measure.

\- A few cloves of garlic, diced

\- a few pieces of fermented bean curds that you can buy from Chinese grocery stores (some well-stocked Korean markets and Thai markets might have them as well)

\- Salt, as needed.

&amp;#x200B;

Steps:

\- Heat up some oil in a hot pan. Once the oil is hot, add the garlic and stir fry for a few seconds until fragrant.

\- Then put the water spinach into the pot, and stir fry

\- Once the water spinach looks like it's semi-cooked, add in the fermented beancurds -- make sure they evenly coat all the water spinach. Since the beancurds are already fairly salty, you want to taste the water spinach to see if it needs more salt.

Voila!",1
Looks amazing. Is there a guideline / recipe?,1
Had this at a restaurant earlier this year and it was very tasty. Haven't made it at home before though!,1
Yeeees! I love ong choy -- probably one of my favorite vegetables. I sometimes would separate the leafy part from the stemmy part and cook them separately. The stemmy part is so good when you just crush it with the blade of a cleaver and stir fried it with  dried fermented black beans. Yummy!,1
Love ong choy with fermented bean curd! So good with your fish as well :D,1
Ah lovely. ♡,1

"Yeah, when my grandpa was in Shanghai in the 30s, salted pork was such a luxury, they use to go to the kitchen of big restaurants on the bund and wash dishes &amp; move boxes just for some meat scraps &amp; trimmings since the western bankers &amp; diplomats didn’t like the fatty greasy taste. This was a dish for those in the tough times, glad that we can have it as an memory to a harder time, not a necessity for survival.",1
"Get one, make you life so much easier, you can make jook, bake cakes, ferment black garlic, make braised chicken, steam buns, it’s pretty amazing! Even my super cheap/simple one (I got at a thrift store for like 6$) can do most of the above!",1
"Spicy intestines going in, spicy intestines coming out.  I've never had that but it looks divine if it's as tender as you say.",1
"I agree! I had to cut back on the amount of cantonese lap cheong that I used. It's the sweetness that kinda overpowers all the other flavors. 

I asked some older folks from shanghai, and they said that the laap cheung / salt pork was luxury. The way they remember it was just rice, veggie and lard. It was called shabby rice because veg was cheap (some of the stuff they ate grew wild), and they would just pour some pork fat on the rice for a dish. 

Will amend my post later.",1
"Yours looks good! This dish is such a peasant dish that whatever ways one cooks it, it’s probably alright. My method is to let the rice cook with the lap cheong, sauté the stem &amp; leaf of bok choy at different times, then add them as the rice is being cooked, then mix everything with lard, but yours looks good as well! The only 2 thing I would add is that Cantonese lap cheong is a bit too sweet for this, a Jiangsu style lap cheong would be a lot more balanced; the second, lard, add a lot of lard, I think the soul of the dish is the lard, and the pork rind, that provides that extra crunch in a very homogeneous dish!",1

"Woks of life with some small modifications- I cut off and render the chicken fat and don’t use any added oil. 2x the dried chilis and 20 or so cracked open cause I like it hot, and 2x the Hua Jiao.  And I add a sliced shallot fried with the garlic.",1
I love 豆花 too 😻,1
I bought it on Yamibuy.com (I live in the US),1
I wanted to make them pink 😅,1
These look adorable!,1
Thanks for the info.  I wasn't aware that chongqing was its own region similar to Chengdu.  I did a little more digging to understand better and least from western info chongqing is much more spice/mala forward!,1
"Chongqing chicken is the English name for la zi ji.

Just curious what you would use this on?  Or is it more of a sauce you add to anything?  It looks tasty.,1
Lazi Ji is a Sichuan dish; Chongqing is a distinct subcategory of Sichuan cuisine that in my experience tends to make things spicier and heavier use of Sichuan peppercorns.,1
Can I have an order of this shipped to me? 🤤,1
Delicious.,1

"Essentially yes, and I posted there too 😁",1
Yep! We will have to try and make these this weekend!,1
"That made me sweat just looking at it, is this Chongquing Chicken?  r/spicy would dig this photo.",1
Awesome thanks!,1
"YES!!! (that's what I used!) 

It's a bit ""cheesy-ish"" to do, but I happen to love this fake crab junk

sub in your fav fillings, doesn't have to be pork! 

haha",1
"And just sub the crabmeat in for the pork? Does it work with imitation crab?

Thanks!",1

I loosely follow her recipe(s), she's amazing....

Do you have a recipe?,1
"I called them bunbuns lol  
They are actually called Bao Zi 包子in mandarin. Most baozi use yeast in the dough and then steamed or maybe pan fried. For dumplings, there is no yeast in the dough, just water/flour. Most dumplings are boiled or can be steamed or fried too. 

Baozi has a soft chewy texture. 

Amanda",1
"Hey! At first glance, I thought these are steamed dumplings! But then I read that you have written bunbuns! Are these different from dumplings? I haven't heard of these before!",1
I think I replied below.. still trying to figure out how to use Reddit ..,1
"Similar but for baozi filling, I mix some water into the regular ground beef, one egg and then stir together until it is pasty and then mix in the chopped vegetables. I chopped the vegetables with knifes instead of food processor. So you can still taste the texture of the vegetables. 

For dumpling filling, I don’t put in additional water. The rest I do the same. 
 : ) 
Amanda",1
Thank you so much ❤️,1
It looks like 水煮牛肉 mixed with 水饺，try to cut the beef thinly.,1
After watching Goldthread’s YouTube video about food in Sichuan I was interested in trying to make a spicy rabbit dish. I found [this recipe](https://www.asianfoodtrail.com/spicy-hare-sichuan-style-recipe/). I substituted bell pepper with green beans because it’s what I had. I’m very happy with how it turned out.,1
"What about for the filling? We have a killer jiaozi recipe, do you use the same for both your jiaozi and baozi?",1
Oh yes the filling is lamb and tomato and the pieces are beef sorry if I didn't catch it sooner,1
Thank you,1
No is beef I woke up and my mom made beef stock so I used beef pieces,1
"Thanks, you mean the dumplings are filled with lamb and tomato? The meat in the soup is lamb too?",1
"Yup those are homemade dumplings with lamb and tomatoes. The soup is: in tbs 1 of soy sauce, 1 dark soy sauce, 1 black vinegar, 1 sugar, 1 sesame oil, 1 sesame seeds, 3 of chili oil. Green onions and parsley and 3 ladles of beef stock.",1
That looks delicious - you made it?,1
Recipe? :),1
Saving this comment for the recipe.  Thanks! 👍,1
"Here is my dough recipe: 
3 cups of all purpose flour
1/2 tablespoon of sugar (yeast loves sugar of course)
1 1/4 teaspoons of instant yeast (find the ones says instant yeast on the label.)
Then add 1 1/3 cups of warm water over everything.

Kneed it into a dough. Cover and let it rise for at least 1 hour or until it double in size. 

I put the dough near my heater vent. If your oven has a dough proofing function, use the oven. Mine doesn’t. 

Once the dough is ready, I put about 1/2 teaspoon of oil over the dough before I divide the dough. 

I steamed the buns on high for 20 mins. (No need for the dough to rise a second time. )

Amanda",1
yo. not bad. i just moved back to the states and im really missing baozi. any tips on doing the dough?,1

Where can I buy this jelly boob?,1
"Yum! I once purchased 豆花 at an Asian supermarket with brown sugar syrup. Delicious! 

I usually can tolerate Asian snacks, because they tend to be milder in flavor than Western/American snacks, which tend to be super-sweet.",1

Oh no,1
Lovely looking char siu! Great job :D,1
these noodles like like fishing lures! The char siew looks good,1
Yooo I want to visit new York so bad ahahhaha don't let my childhood dream vanish all of a sudden ahahabba,1
I'll switch places with you ANYTIME.,1
It should be pretty hard to find it in Italy ahahhaha thanks for the reply.,1
"Idk where to get the flour but I bought the noodles at an Asian Market on 10th Street in the East Village, NYC.",1
Those noodles looks amazing 😍 where can I get that flour? Or can I just grind up some black rice?,1
Wrong cut of pork :(,1
The package said boneless pork roast but it certainly looks like loin.,1
That pork looks excellent,1
Oh nice! Is that pork tenderloin there?,1
These noodles are indeed special. I love rice noodles but I prefer more taste than the average rice noodles. These are wheat flour with black rice added. They're really tasty on their own.,1
"Oooh, those noodles are looking boss. Never had that style.",1
🥳,1
Thank you. Might try it this week.,1
Don’t see a link?,1
"I understand, you could add whatever this is just the more 'traditional' option, without is also lovely though! Maybe you could add some different flavors e.g. teriyaki",1
Thank you &amp; thanks for the recipe link. I would like to try to add some different things in it eventually but I am not crazy about cooked carrots &amp; I do not like regular peas 😅,1
I just wanted to give an update. I tried the chili oil yesterday and didn't have an allergic reaction to it. Thank you everyone for all the information in the thread.,1

It looks great. I would recommend adding salt and a pinch of sugar instead of adding more soy.,1
Haha yes !,1
I bet it took longer to type the recipe than to make the dish?,1
I am ALWAYS up for red braised pork. That looks like heaven.,1
"These look nice but if you take advice from me, add some chopped carrots, Cabbage, and bell peppers! They give an awesome look to the egg fried rice! Just give it a try and you won't regret!",1
"Hi, I only had 20mins to make dinner tonight. So it is quite easy.
1. Half pound of beef sliced and diced into small pieces. 
2. 2 stalks of celery. Dice into small pieces. Use the celery leaves too. They have great flavor too. 
3. Fresh Cilantro - stalk and leaves- cut into small pieces - about 1 cup
4. Dice 2 medium size tomatoes.
5. Fry the beef with celery, 1/2 cup of the cut cilantro,  at least 2 tablespoons of oil- over medium high heat until the beef is browned on both sides. Then add Chinese 5 spice, black pepper, white pepper and ground Sichuan peppercorn (1/8 teaspoon each). Add dash of salt at the end and then take everything out. 

6.Now we will make the broth. Use the same pan that we fried the beef thingy, fry the diced tomatoes until tender and then add in 1/2 cup of tomato based pasta sauce (you can use all just fresh tomatoes, but I only 20 mins tonight) and then add in water 4- 5 cups, dash of chicken stock, 1 table spoon of onion powder, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of soy sauce and  salt about 1 teaspoon.
Bring this broth until boil. 

7. Add back in the beef mixture and then sprinkle the remaining cilantro (1/2 cup) and serve.

We ate it with steamed rice tonight. But probably work with garlic bread, buns, pita bread, cheese toast... 

Amanda",1
Looks great. Recipe?,1
Add just a dash of white pepper at the end too,1
Thank you,1
look nice,1
Thank you!!,1
"Looks good, successful first attempt!",1
"Ah thanks so much for that. I love cooking and do it every single day pretty much, so I hope I’m at least decent 😅👌🏻🙏🏻",1
"Jacque Pepin and Julia Child have a cute TV show where they cook together, but they have the most passive aggressive debates over whether white or black pepper is superior. I swear if the camera was off, Julia would club Jacque with her rolling pin and Jacque would shank Julia with his paring knife. 

Loved em. Great dynamic ahahaha",1
Not bad! My first attempt I remember was a burnt disaster lol,1
Yep. Its on amazon and the asian market. I cook for my shrimp/oyster eating family and they say my food tastes the same as takeout:),1
Beautiful. You are a natural.,1
"Yup I put a very small amount towards the end, toasted sesame oil",1
I like a tiny bit of sesame oil on mine.,1
I don’t know how to highlight someone’s reply but yes it is great advice.,1
"If you have a serious allergy I would avoid ALL foods you are uncertain about. I would also avoid all food that say “may contain...”, “processed on the same machinery as...” and “produced in the same warehouse as....”. I have some serious allergies and have found that most foods have that allergen in it and that’s their disclaimer so they can’t be held responsible for a irresponsible decision.",1
"It's worth highlighting the edit of the poster above.

For the longest time I was confused as to how to get that dark glossy look some fried rice has (ruined a lot of fried rice adding too much soy sauce). The trick is just a small splash of dark soy. Gives that American Chinese takeout vibe.",1
Chinese fried rices rarely have soy sauce in them. Salt is much more common.,1
Thanks so much!,1
Looks pretty good already!,1
Can’t do shrimp but I do want to add some nice pork next time. Didn’t want to get too cocky on my first go 😅👌🏻,1
"I made them today!! Your youtube video was very informative - I’ve subscribed to your channel actually, I’m going to make the sesame tangyuan next - and they came out really well!! It’s so satisfying to twist the dough into the bun shape",1
 Now add some shrimp or ham,1
🙏🏻🙏🏻,1
"&gt;finely ground white pepper

Good call. I always put white pepper in my fried rice. Severely underrated and underutilized spice among Westerners. Every time I'm watching some cooking show or video where some presumably famous white chef says they use black pepper for everything and don't see the point of white pepper, I think to myself, ""Stupid clumsy barbarian! Your palate lacks nuance and subtlety!""",1
Fuyoh!!,1
Interesting.  Thanks !,1
I'm Taiwanese and I've always added salt and MSG to my fried rice (so has my mom and my grandmother before her). In fact we don't use any soy sauce at all. Fried rice in Asia tends to be less soy sauce forward than fried rice you find in Chinese restaurants in the US.,1
"Thanks! Will try white pepper if I can find it. Did the rest of this except MSG, will be using porcini mushroom powder next time.",1
I had replied to another comment that suggested this as well. I have a mild shrimp allergy so was hesitant but now know there is also a version that doesn’t have shellfish. Also couldn’t find oyster sauce at the store but I’m still learning to navigate the Asian grocery store I went to. I am gonna try porcini mushroom powder next time for umami flavor 👌🏻,1
Thank you! I was definitely intimidated to try but am so glad I did. For me this was dry but definitely matched the texture of what you’d get in a restaurant but I would like more flavor. Will be trying porcini mushroom powder in it next go around.,1
How about a splash of fish or oyster sauce?,1
"I like my fried rice white, the brown stuff with soy sauce turns me off",1
Don't think I've ever seen an Asian in a video adding salt .... MSG might give it some umami though ...,1
I still can't get it right but I think that most of us trying to do it add too much liquid.  Good stuff in restaurants doesn't seem wet.  Yours looks pretty good though.  I guess I have to start experimenting again ... I love me some fried rice ...,1
🙏🏻🙏🏻😁,1
"Thank you, this was pretty dry &amp; I wouldn’t want to go drier but finishing off with more heat sounds good.",1
"Sounds great, I’ll have to look for that, thank you 🙏🏻",1
"I’ve never seen it without seafood in it, I’ll have to have a better look next time. Thanks!",1
Good try,1
You can buy oyster sauce without any seafood in it. Oyster sauce is a pantry staple and is quite good.,1
"I'm allergic to shellfish and but vegetarian oyster sauce, made with mushrooms and it's absolutely a perfect dupe.",1
"You need to use both dark and normal soy sauce, oyster sauce, and MSG. That will make it much better.",1
"My thoughts: a tad drier would be great. Finish off with high heat until you see the rice ""dance"" in the wok.",1
Why ruin that lovely rice and kill the flavour with soy sauce  :  (,1
Delicious.🍛🍲🥘🍜,1
I have a huge Asian grocery store near me &amp; will definitely have a look. Definitely wanting to try the porcini mushroom powder though as that will be some lovely umami flavor. But the chicken bouillon I will try the time after. Definitely want to play around &amp; see what I enjoy best. Thank you for all the recs 🙏🏻,1
"Another trick is to use chicken bouillon powder. But you have to get the stuff sold in Asian markets. It has salt, MSG, inosinate, and guanylate, which basically all work synergistically to add a lot of umami kick. You can usually find [Knorr](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00521V4AM/) or [Lee Kum Kee](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001DMTNC/) in Asian markets or even well-stocked standard supermarkets.",1
What’s the recipe?!,1
"I was going to but had read that it should be “oyster” sauce &amp; could not find it when I went shopping. Also, I am mildly allergic to shrimp so was also hesitant for that reason.",1
Try a splash of fish sauce instead of soy.  You’ll thank me.,1
Looks perfect to me. I don’t add soy sauce when I cook my fried rice. I let each individual add it to taste on their plate.,1
"Ah thank you! I do not want it to taste like soy sauce but I was definitely missing something &amp; I went light on scallion cause I only used it to top it. There is sweet white onion in the rice itself along with some garlic. It’s cooked in peanut oil and finished with some toasted sesame oil. I don’t have msg but do have powdered porcini mushroom, I think I will add that next time I make it. I was so intimidated to make this but am so glad I finally did it, I’m very pleased.",1
"Looks pretty good actually. Based solely on the appearance I’d say needs more scallion, but probably adequate soy sauce. I’d suggest adding some salt and MSG if it didn’t taste seasoned enough (unless you like your fried rice to taste pretty strongly of soy sauce).",1
"【SWEETCORN AND EGG DROP SOUP】  \~I WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE IT UNDER 10 MINUTES AT HOME!    DEFINITELY BETTER THAN TAKEOUT!!  Sweetcorn Egg Drop Soup is usually available on most Chinese restaurant menus if you look for it, and is a welcome change over the usual wonton, hot and sour, and egg drop soup standard trio of favorites. Kick off the start of cold weather days with this one!  This recipe is for 3-4 ppl  1/4 cup diced onion 420g canned creamed corn 700ml veg or chicken stock 1 fresh egg 2 tbs cornstarch 2 tbs water spring onion salt and white pepper to taste  Enjoy!!",1
Wow. Wow and yum!!,1
"Been trying to find a recipe for General Tso’s that tastes like our local takeout but no dice. This looks like it, though! Care to share the recipe?",1
nice， i like it,1
I got it for around $2 at an Asian supermarket,1
how much?Is it expensive  ?,1
Cockles,1
perfection on a plate :),1
I think it looks just as delicious without the soy sauce! Looks qq :),1
"Chili oil, soy sauce, black vinegar, garlic, and green onions!",1
I love shiitake mushrooms. They are so chewy and flavorful... but they come with a relatively high price tag. My favorite kind.,1
What’s the sauce!,1
This looks sad,1
Yes. You need the sweet soy,1
Those are the duck's intestines,1
"If you're familiar with Chinese ingredients and know what to look for, I honestly buy most things from Yamibuy if I'm not shopping at a local Asian grocery store. 99Ranch also has a website and they deliver even to cities that don't have the stores, and you can also check delivery apps like Chowbus or Weee! to see if they offer grocery delivery to where you live. The website you listed seems really overpriced for basic Chinese ingredients tbh, it seems like a small family run business so I don't fault them for marketing to people in the West who might not be super familiar with traditional Chinese ingredients yet but you can definitely get those ingredients for much cheaper at local markets or Yamibuy.",1
Definitely looks a little sad without the sauce.,1

The truth is often downvoted on Reddit.  People downvote a fact if they don't like it regardless if it is true or not.  Doesn't bother me.  I'm sure many people learned a little bit from the post ...,1
"You're getting down voted but I've lived in china for years and this is absolutely true. If you have a serious allergy, I wouldn't trust anything from a factory that also makes other products containing peanuts.",1
"I mean it doesn’t have them listed in the ingredients, and I assume they would have gotten into legal trouble if it contained peanuts but didnt say",1
"I mean there's an ingredients list right on the label, in English, for sale in the US.

So, no. It's actually safer to assume they aren't hiding peanuts in there for no reason.",1
"Hi! I'd recommend a rice roll steamer box. It's what I use and great for cheung fun.

"I could see some Chinese company not having peanuts as an ""official"" ingredient but not properly cleaning the mixing and cooking equipment between products.   If I were you I'd feed it to my little brother first (assuming he has the allergy too) as a test .... The Chinese will use ground up plaster wallboard as an ingredient.  You just never know ...",1
Lol 😉,1
"Not all plants are completely edible. However, you can actually consume the entire sunflower in one form or another. Right from the root to the petals.",1
All of this line is usually a combination of peanut and another vegetable oil(for price point). Traditionally it’s peanut oil and/or animal fat used in Chinese cooking. If I run out of peanut oil and use sunflower the whole family notices.,1
It's actually Xian Cai 苋菜 - but yours is close enough haha! I love this vegetable since childhood. The secret is to put loads of garlic and put the whole thing including that shiny red soup on rice. My fav dinner in hot summertime.,1
"I've seen this and other products under the same brand at stores in Canada. They all either contain peanuts or are labelled as ""may contain"". If your allergy is serious enough then best to avoid.",1
"And it’s just fried rice, why do you need them in balls",1
Has your partner had the oil in the picture I posted above?,1
Oh wow I use to watch alot of his videos on strictly dumpling. I didn't know he started selling food/chili oil. I might have to try it out lol.,1
"https://mikeshotoil.com/

I too have a peanut allergy and have never been able to eat lao gan ma (way too risky). I'm planning to buy the oil 3-pack soon, they have clear labels in English and no peanuts. (creator is Mikey Chen)",1
"Yeah, that's why I used sesame seeds in my recipe instead of peanuts.  They still give it a nutty flavor, but avoid the allergy issue.  I have somebody who's allergic to peanuts in my family, it sucks going to the ER on a Friday evening when all you wanted to do was sit down to a nice meal.",1
"That's a great point, especially since another similar product called laoganma fried chili in oil has peanuts in its ingredients list. I wish I had a more definite yes or no answer, but maybe it not having peanuts labeled is my answer. Thanks

edit: making it homemade is probably the easiest solution. Thanks for the recipe, I'll try it out.",1
"That sentence is referring to traditional recipes for chili crisp, not Lao Gan Ma.  Lao Gan Ma has no garlic or peanuts.",1
"I don't know why people are telling you what they are, but Lao Gan Ma doesn't contain peanuts.  Some recipes for traditional chili crisp do, but Lao Gan Ma is a hugely popular brand in the US and if they omitted an important allergen like peanuts on their label they would have been sued into oblivion a long time ago.  If you're super paranoid, here's my recipe I've been working on that I think is actually better than Lao Gan Ma in some ways:

“Spicy chili crisp is a blend of various chili peppers, soybean oil, garlic, onions, spices, soybeans and peanuts. “

so yes this contains peanuts.",1

I saw another version of it called “fried chili in oil” that had peanuts labeled in the english ingredients list. Since this version doesn’t have peanuts labeled in english I thought maybe I got lucky lol. Thank you,1
Yes.,1

For example date stamp may say “2020 11 30” and its packaging says “good for 12 months”. However, when its imported into the US, there can be changes due to US label requirements. Main point, the date might be date made and not best by. :)",1
yes i could. i'm just trying to perfect the method,1
"Okay thanks! I love me some general tso without the spice, but I will venture out And try orange chicken. Sounds like it would be similar, though not the same.",1

"Somebody made a documentary about this a few years ago. https://youtu.be/gctopt7hPqI

The dish itself is made for a western palette, it’s just my opinion, maybe somebody would be annoyed by this, but it’s like asking for an unsweet iced tea and somebody getting annoyed because they think it’s supposed to always be sweetened? lol, it’s just your preference that you requested, I think it should be ok",1
Hmart or seafood Wholesale vendor if you really want the fresh fresh. Or get it shipped online (cost way more) from some of the popular seafood vendors,1

I was mainly interested in the chestnut/pak choi because I thought it would be a nice side dish in addition - a little less spice for relief haha.",1
[deleted],1
Wow sashimi &amp; pork belly!! Great dinner. :),1
Yeah,1
Wow there's a lot of delicious things going on here! What's that in the top right with the potatoes (I think they're potatoes?)?,1
"I usually get results similar to this using the steam fry method, though I'm using pre-cooked frozen dumplings. 

With steam fry method, can't you just add more water and check the filling with a thermometer?",1
God I was just talking the other day about missing yumcha,1
That’s the good stuff.,1
That’s so cool!,1
"Oh yeah. I make these quite often at home. Just cook rice on a claypot, add in protein (marinated meat, Chinese sausage, etc) half way and end up drizzling it with my concoction of soya sauce.",1
"Thank you so much!! Wow, I never would’ve guessed steak haha.

We appreciate it ☺️",1

Does look good ....,1
I'm still trying to figure out the steaming part. There are parts that are under cooked,1
Thanks I guess that’s a real menu item lol!,1
Right?,1
ooo look at that nice golden brown,1
Yep haha mastered the nuance of heat adjustment and all that!,1
Did he fry them in a pan and then add water to cook them the rest of the way?,1
"Yes what u/yihefeizao said.. I don’t follow a recipe but I think this: https://justhungry.com/low-key-low-carb%20iridofu-scrambled-tofu-vegetables is a good guide from what I searched online (I know this is Japanese guide).. you can also add other items like grated ginger, chopped garlic, little shaoxing wine, etc. But in limited quantities if you want to let the main dish shine more",1
"Tofu is almost completely neutral taste-wise. The flavour of dishes that include tofu is going to be drawn from what's accompanying it (meat, vegetables, sauce, seasonings, etc.).",1
I'm not really a huge potato person if I'm honest. I rarely have them throughout the week. I could do some combos with potatoes though. Thank you for the suggestion.,1
"I am from the UK too, if you ever get the chance you should try it, easy to make at home too. Chips aren't my thing if I'm honest, maybe with some chilli, garlic and salt they would amp it up or make a great side to the beef. I haven't tried much things in rice except for chicken or pork, I've never really tried doing egg fried rice and either. But thanks for your suggestions, I'll have to look into it. Some steamed buns do sound good, I'll look up a recipe later. Thank you!",1
That's a great suggestion thank you. It would definitely be different.,1
"We do a yellow rice. Probably not the same as some restaurants though. We add some turmeric and chilli flakes to plain white rice, it comes out yellow with a little spice. It's quite nice.",1
"Unfortunately I do not have any Asian markets nearby, mostly in the city,  but I have been meaning to go to one, just everything going on is difficult at the moment. I'll take these into consideration for later use. Thank you for your suggestion.",1
"Thank you! It Sounds good, however could you probably describe what Tofu tastes like, I have not had Tofu before?",1
"Thanks that's a good variety there. I haven't had some of these ever, so I better get tasting too see what works for me.",1
"Thank you! I'm no expert myself which is self explanatory 😅 I've had wild rice before that might go well with crispness of the beef. Unfortunately I don't think I have any Asian markets nearby, let alone with the virus going around atm. I'll take the suggestions into consideration for the future though. Thank you.",1
Kimchi and Chinese food. Do you want to start an argument? Hahaha,1
"Not something I've tried but here (Bristol, UK) it is really popular to have chips with Chinese takeaway food.

Have you tried different stuff in the rice? I like egg or vegetable fried rice (but you can probably do a boiled/steamed verson instead).

Boiled potatoes or steamed buns are good options too!",1
"Potatoes! I can't eat beef anymore, but lordy lordy, I used to go bonkers for really any preparation of beef + potatoes + onions!",1
"Yeah. Hopefully someone who has eaten there and has a good tongue for spices can help me. 🙂 Also, the Fat No in the description was a typo, it’s Fat Ni.",1
"Oh. Probably some sort of secret seasoning like in fast food restaurants, idk how we would know.",1
It’s a restaurant. They’re known for their grilled skewers and have always wondered what mixture of herbs and spices they use to season them.,1
"I like to sub tamarind in anything that has molasses/brown sugar and a vinegar ingredient. It's great in BBQ sauces and salad dressings! You can also use it to make an excellent rum drink, but it's been so long that I made one that I can't remember the proportions!",1
What is Fat Ni/Fat No? Is that a food?,1
"I very much agree, but on rice. Rice has so many varieties, more than just the plain white at restaurants. Sushi rice, brown, black, even red and yellow exists.",1
Spaghetti squash pad thai with tofu:),1
"Mantou are a great option, especially if there is a bit of sauciness to mop up.",1
"What about steamed buns like mantou? If you have access to an Asian supermarket you can get frozen ones which just need steaming for 10 mins without needing to make from scratch.

Otherwise I second the other poster on varieties of rice and noodles. Different types can have vastly different textures and flavours - a thin egg noodle which can be fried crisp is very different to an udon.",1
Steamed ground pork meat cake/patty with the preserved radish. Then fried chives with egg.,1
Of course!!,1
Thanks!!,1
Thanks!!,1
Ooohh thank you!,1
"Bean sprout, tofu, cooked soy, tofu skin, mung bean noodles/sheets (gluten free, very proteic), vegetable spagetthi (zucchini, carrot, beet, etc), any grain (millet, sorghum, wheat) and a lot of seeds (hemp seed), tapioca starch noodle (grain free noodle), konyaku noodles/shreded (japanese food but a alternative) and tapioca pearl {odd choise).",1
"Scrambled egg with chinese preserved radish. Soak first to remove the salt, then squeeze dry. Chop onion and garlic, fry with the radish, then add the beaten eggs. Season if needed, then eat with hot rice.  


Here's a recipe: [https://rasamalaysia.com/fried-eggs-with-preserved-turnip/](https://rasamalaysia.com/fried-eggs-with-preserved-turnip/)",1
"Preserved radish can be eaten alone and with bread or Chinese pancake, and chives can also be in pancake instead of scallions! Chives have many many uses, radish is usually eaten alone. Tamarind paste good luck, I don’t know.",1
My partner and I have started eating tofu to replace rice in our dinners a few times a week.,1
"A very simple dish, but I love scrambled eggs with chives.",1
"Interesting question. I'm no expert on Chinese food, but from an eater of various foods- maybe try different kinds of rice or noodles.

There are lots of different kinds of rice- brown, wild, different kinds of white, sticky/glutinous, red. Same with noodles- ""ramen,"" rice, sweet potato, varying thicknesses. Having access to an Asian market will help. If not, there's always buying stuff online.",1
"For beginner, I recommend you try to cook with some premade sauces. Oyster Sauce goes well with many different stir fries. It is savory and sweet. Not sour at all.",1
this indian food ?,1
"Lol, it’s ‘but’. The title doesn’t show complete",1
"I cut them into inch-length pieces and braise them in soy sauce and gochugaru. Coat in oligodang to finish. 

I’ve also used them in place of green beans",1
So is she placing the charcoal coals below the pot inside the the grill basin? Or are the charcoals in the tower below the basin? Couldn’t quite tell in the video.,1
Came here to say this,1
"It's a thing in Hunan but not as popular as other dishes. Even the restaurants in Hunan don't usually have this dish on their menu. As for the chestnuts, Chinese chestnuts are tree chestnuts so it’s better to use tree chestnuts for this dish.",1

Can you use the whole length of these? How do you prepare them?,1

"I've not heard of garlic chives. 蒜苗 is what I use, looks like fat green onion, and very smelly, I can't put them in the fridge or it's unbearable.

"Are garlic shoots the same as garlic chives? Long and flat? I also make it with those sometimes. I personally prefer the leeks a little more. Love garlic chives when I can get them, though!",1
"I highly recommend trying with garlic shoots instead of leeks, they are hard to find though.",1
"&gt;He's clearly wrong

Ahahahahaha


Thanks for the link. I will try the steaming/vinegar method soon. Yeah eggplants are like sponges and absorb a lot of oil normally.

I actually do rolling cut as well normally when I don't deep fry the eggplants. But I do it not for texture reasons but because I'm too lazy to cut them into thin pieces lol.",1
Good enough!,1
"The vinegar is to help with the color. We have been getting pretty anemic looking eggplants in general from delivery services, definitely no deep purple. They will bit greyer than deep fried unfortunately. But they absorb way less oil this way, so it's a healthy trade-off I'm happy to make.

This is my not too spicy version: https://www.thericelover.com/yuxiang-eggplant/

I cut rolling cut instead of strips because my husband doesn't like soft, melt-y eggplant. He's clearly wrong, but that's compromise I guess...",1
"How does steaming affect the color? I usually don't deep fry eggplants either. I just salt the eggplants to remove excess liquid, but when cooked this way, the eggplant skins lose the nice deep purple color.",1
"Same here. I try to avoid deep frying as much as possible. For fish fragrant eggplants, I steam the eggplants in cornstarch and a touch of vinegar. It's not quite as melt-y as deep fried, but it's so much less messy.",1
Just to add: you don't need to deep fry the tofu. I normally don't. You can just pan fry the tofu to brown the sides. And I used firm tofu,1
Thanks!,1
"Ugh I forgot to make rice, so I ended up eating bread with the dishes loool",1
I love that eggplant you made!! Pass a (huge) bowl of rice and I'll devour it all,1
"Absolutely! I love making it -- though I typically don't deep fry the tofu, and instead I just pan fry it first before adding liquid, so it's much less of a hassle to make.",1
Braised tofu is one of the most underrated dishes in Chinese cooking. Looks delicious!,1
How did you make the tofu? It looks amazing!,1
"A nice recipe, slightly different than the one I created on my food truck. I’ll give it a try.",1
Chilean sea bass is my favorite fish. Its like eating butter.,1
Fresh is better for fermentation especially if you want to use the chilies later in dishes instead of just adding flavor for the brine 😊😊😊,1
"Do you have a recommendation between fresh or dried red Thai chiles for the ferment?  I've got fresh in the freezer and dried in the pantry.  I'm ok with the heat level, I typically increase the amount of chiles in the recipe.",1
Fresh Thai bird’s eye or fresh Tabasco work great — Tabasco has closer heat level tho.,1
Would dried Thai chiles be a good substitute in the ferment?  I can't find heaven facing chiles where I live but I have a half kilo bag of Thais.,1
No Dans were harmed in the making of these noodles!,1
"It sounds delicious and should work just fine! If you are not too worried about changing the taste of your brine as a whole you can add a handful of Sichuan peppercorn and some ginger blobs -- that'll get you pretty close！
I also have a recipe for if you want to start a Sichuan pickle jar at home:
https://vivsyummytown.com/sichuan-pickled-veggies",1
"I will let you know, I just wish I had access to the Sichuan fermented chiles for the authentic taste.  I'm going to use a home ferment instead that's a combination of Fresnos, habaneros, garlic, and salt that went for about 2 months.  It's my magical condiment, I put it on everything.",1
Yay hope to get to hear how it turns out! My husband’s best man just tried it last week and he loved it.,1
"I saved your recipe from the last time you posted this dish, I've got some eggplants in my fridge and can't wait to try it.",1
"Yep, it is quite easy tbh. It's just assembling very low effort components.",1
This looks so tasty and nice and easy to make?,1
These are sooo good!! Can't wait to visit my grandmother so I can have these again. Happy Lantern Festival :),1
Yes! Thanks!,1
I love tang yuan! With black sesame inside? Looks good,1
"Egg and tomato soup goes good with fried rice and is very easy to cook. 

Sometimes I make very simple vegetable fried rice and serve it alongside stir fried dishes. 

Most of the time I make it as the meal and add shrimp, chicken, la chang, or spam and frozen vegetable medley. Quick and easy dinner with very few dishes to do. Haha!",1
If you can find it Cantonese Lap Cheong is fantastic with egg fried rice.,1
"How did you like it? I like the ones that are layered (can't really think of a different word to describe it), it has a much different texture than the solid tofu gan. I even found one recently that is cube(ish)-shaped latiao, and it has a really unique spongey texture. 

I will keep a lookout for the one you bought, I don't remember seeing it but I would like to check out the texture. Cheers!",1
"Filling is sweet, the outside is plain (no sugar). The liquid is just the water from boiling them. Can be different fillings like: red bean, peanut, or black sesame. I’ve also seen ones filled with jam. They are delicious!",1
"Hands down, my FAVOURITE dessert of all time.",1
"I love those too, probably my favourite Chinese dessert except maybe annin tofu",1
I just wanted to know what it was. You answered the question. Thank you!,1
"It's beef-flavored bean curd. Are you wanting more of it translated, or just what the food is?",1
"These look so beautiful! I have never eaten them! Are these sweet? I think they are in sugar syrup? Actually, I once ate an Indian sweet that resembles this tangyuan! Can you post the recipe?? I will definitely try it if it is sweet!",1
i need to make these,1
Metaphorically stole.,1
"Aw, my parents always make the ones with peanut filling, so I am partial to those. 😁",1
Here you go! https://youtu.be/KYXWMUy6MJo,1

I want to use your recipe to make scallion oil to eat with rice :),1
Thank you for your answer!,1
I stir fry the spices and add sauce to the pan to boil for 1 min; the spices and stir frying step are not necessary — you can just bring the sauce to boil and boil for 1 min.,1
Do you cook the sauce mix together beforehand or just mix it in with the noodles?,1

* Ground star anise | 1 pinch
* Ground Cinnamon | 1 pinch

*Sauce mix:* 

* Light soy sauce | 1.5 tbsp
* Dark soy sauce | 1.5 tbsp
* Sugar | 1 tbsp
* Filtered water | 3 tbsp
* Chicken bouillon | 0.5 tsp
* Salt | 0.5 tsp

*Scallion oil:*

* Scallions | 50 g
* Canola oil | 0.5 cup

The sauce, oil and crispy scallions keep for weeks so this is more than one meal's worth. To assemble just boil noodles and combine with sauce, oil, crisps and other toppings to your heart's desire!",1

"Could I shoulder surf your mother? I love Chinese food and am teaching myself how to make various things but would love to watch someone and ask questions. I find it hard to learn from YouTube videos, a real shame the one you recommend isn’t in English!",1
Yes! Give me 30 min 🥰,1
I had a version of this at home and it blew my mind how flavorful it is even through the ingredients are simple and few.,1
"Oh,  I didn't see that there were more than one, lovely :) the first one was the one that I was initially interested in, beansprouts, with beef or pork? 

The second one, the tofu dish, that looks interesting too. 

I assume that the third is water chestnuts?",1

"That looks nice, and pretty straightforward. Any chance of a quick recipe?",1
"I have Yan Kit's Classic Chinese Cookbook and think it's great. I bought it even though I had a good grasp of Chinese cooking because this it was more formal than, say, years of shoulder surfing my mother. What drew me at the bookstore was the walkthrough of ingredients and techniques - it's nice to have that info laid out in front of you so that you can appreciate it at your own pace *in a book* rather than to pause/replay a blurry video. Most of the cookbook includes dishes that I have tried in one form or another so it resonated with me. On YouTube, that experience is much more inconsistent because the recipes that popped up in my feed seemed more ""trendy"" than traditional. 

(I only know one YT channel that works for me and that is 職人吹水 (No, it's not in English).)",1
"2 tablespoons sugar dissolved in 2 tablespoons hot water.  Brush it on as soon as you take the hot buns out of the oven.  Don't worry your buns won't get soggy - The heat from the buns will cause the water to evaporate quickly.  The buns will take on an attractive and delicious shiny, sweet glaze.  Nom nom nom.",1
which one?,1
I think it's just sugar and water for the glaze.,1
Evidently they have some at $50 and some at $15. It’s ridiculous but go shop the bargain shelf cookbooks and there may be some of the $15 ones there. I wouldn’t have known if the store clerk hadn’t of told me!,1

My failure rate from this book was over 50% - either cooking process (under/overcooked, wrong consistency) or quality of final product. They flooded the market with this series of national cuisine encyclopedias a few years back. Shows just how hard it is to write a good cookbook!",1
"You really need access to an Asian supermarket like Lotte, HMart, or Great Wall. Online grocers might carry most of the spices and dried ingredients but not the fresh produce or meats.",1
"Don't let me stop you from posting some of the results here. I didn't copy the review to say the book is not useful (I don't own it myself).

Only posting a book cover though is just another form of advertising without any substantial information, I think. 

What about the ingredients in the book? Are most of them readily available?",1
"It’s worth a lot more. I almost paid $50 and then the B&amp;N clerk says “hey, we’ve got identical books on the bargain isle”... and sure enough there it was!

The best Chinese cooking channel i have especially for westerners is Chinese cooking demystified. There is very little i have used in the Chinese cookbook from phaidon besides giving me a launching a platform. I had better success with the Mexico and Thailand cookbooks.,1
"The book itself has a rating of 4.15 stars at goodreads. As per usual, the highest ratings are not helpful at all. I mean where do you even get *soft shell turtle* outside of China/Asia?

&gt;What would you recommend as an alternative cookbook?  

None. I would recommend youtube channels or blogs (of which there are plenty), especially since a lot of them use ""western"" kitchen appliances so copying their technique is way easier.",1
Check out Fuschia Dunlop or Yan Kit So both have truly excellent books on regional Chinese cooking and a wealth of information on where to buy and what to look for in ingredients as well as techniques.,1
That juiciness is everything 👏👏👏,1
This looks absolutely delicious! Would love to eat this!,1

"&gt;Jesse De Angelis, Feb 09, 2017 ★★☆☆☆  
This is, as seems usual for Phaidon, a comprehensive but very sloppy cookbook.  
The recipe for Taro Paste with Ginkgo Nuts on page 632, for example, includes directions for preparing a lotus root despite there being no lotus root in the recipe.  
There are numerous errors like this, as well as smaller typos, throughout the book. This makes it hard to have confidence in any of the recipes. Additionally, the food photography seems not to actually match the dishes as described in the recipes, frequently featuring garnishes, ingredients or sauces not mentioned in the text.

&gt;There are also not very many descriptions of dishes, and the book has relatively few pictures. Strangely, most pictures are of the simplest or most familiar dishes, while the ones that were the most complex or unfamiliar to me generally didn't have an accompanying photo or a description of the food at all. [...]",1
phaidon is the best,1
I have this one. There are some great recipes that have become my go-to's.  One of my favorites is tofu with preserved mustard.  The tomato and eggs recipe is great too.,1
Wow!That looks amazing!,1
I wouldn't say it's superior but Yangzhou/huaiyang cuisine is known for its lighter seasoning and more of a focus on the natural flavor of the ingredients. I myself really enjoy the flavor and combination of ingredients and but it all comes down to personal preference. The most noticable flavor in the Yangzhou fried rice is probably the Chinese sausages/lap cheong.,1
That is so amazing!!!,1
I'm a big fan of the Phaidon cookbooks. I've got the Japanese one and it's got so much in there. $15 is awesome!,1
Please snap pictures of your favorite recipes you try in the future!!!,1
"Wow lots of recipe requests! I used two cartons of beef broth and a hunk of beef with a bone in it. I added a cinnamon stick, some star anise, licorice root, a black cardamom, rock sugar, cooking wine, and soy sauce. I set the instapot to broth for One hour and let it naturally release and rest for about 45 mins. I skimmed the broth and added shiitake, wood ear, day lily, lots of white pepper, wonton cut into strips and sweet potato noodles. When it was almost ready I added the chinkiang and some more soy sauce. I don’t thicken the soup like most versions of this recipe call for.",1

"Ingredients

•1 head of cauliflower

•2 cups of bok choy

•2 tbsp olive oil

•2 tsp ground ginger

•1 tbs soy sauce

•1 tsp sesame oil

•1 ½ tsp sesame seeds

•2 tbs stevia sugar substitute

•1 tsp salt

•2 tsp pepper

•green onions to garnish

Directions
If using fresh cauliflower core the cauliflower and chop the florets up into bite size pieces. Also half or quarter the bok choy. Place the cauliflower into a dry wok over high heat and cook the cauliflower for 2-3 minutes stirring constantly. A lot of water will release out of the cauliflower. Drain the water from the wok and then add in the bok choy. Add olive oil, salt and pepper and continue to cook for 60 seconds mixing continuously. Season with ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil sesame seeds and stevia sugar substitute. Mix and continue cooking for 2-3 minutes Once the veggies are softened to your liking remove from heat and serve.",1

"This is the wrong season for mooncakes.  You might try in the late summer/early fall during the Mid-Autumn Festival time.  The Peninsula hotel chain often does unusual flavors when they come out with their mooncakes, but I have not heard of any mass market business that has the flavors you are talking about.",1
What did they pour on them? Looked like water and then something else,1
"Oh! I know what it is now. These are lotus buns (荷叶饼). You put a piece of parchment inside the fold while it steams, just like you put one underneath.

Here's one recipe I found in English: https://thewoksoflife.com/lotus-leaf-buns/",1
I oil the surface they’re being rolled on then use that oily side for the fold. Does that make sense? If I don’t oil where the two sides meet then NOTHING will ever separate them but if you know a better way please share!,1
"Wait, why do you need to oil them? Do you mean oil on the outside?

Baozi rise in the steamer. Oil inhibits rise. I don't think I know anyone who oils the outside... maybe a regional thing?

Try rolling without oil and see what happens?",1

When you touch the Bao flour it already feels different to wheat flour so I'm not sure if that's been your experience and yes the guaranteed bright white with one of the additional salts (I can't remember off the top of my head) is a thing. but I have been told you can try and replicate with a little vinegar in the steaming water? That's what my uncle told me but I've never tried.,1

"The cornflour makes a lot of sense. At this rate I’ll have like 6 different methods and dozens upon dozens of bao to try - no complaints from me!

[Yes this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7T7M4X/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_1AEG1QMVZGW7A3S99XSW),1
Oh awesome! Do you have a specific brand you buy?,1
"Most traditional bao recipes I've found use additionally some wheat starch and/or corn starch which imo makes the dough...smoother and can add to the airyness? I dunno how to describe it but the dough will just straight up feel different when you're kneading than when you use wheat flour (AP/Cake or whatever). 

I recommend this recipe as a starting point https://thewoksoflife.com/steamed-bbq-pork-buns-char-siu-bao/ 

Truthfully where I live they sell the flour pre-mixed (wheat flour + wheat starch + corn starch + some other stuff in and it's called Bao flour) which I end up using most of the time, but I use this filling and it's the closest to restaurant taste, if it's the style you're looking for.",1

"It’s a classic northeastern China dish. Depending on how you make the mentioned tomato egg soup, the main differences are 1. the dough drop soup has small lumps of dough and chopped greens, and 2. the egg is cooked by stirring beaten egg into boiling soup.

In a pinch, I would probably just substitute generic red pepper flakes, the sort that you might see in a pizzeria, with the caveat not to go too heavy on them. It's common to shake out the seeds from whole peppers beforehand so as not to make the final product overly spicy.",1

All the ingredients are packaged separately, so if you want less spicy, I'd recommend buying the spicy one and just adding less of the hot oil or dried peppers.

At the end of the day though, when I eat hot pot most of the flavor comes from the dipping sauce that you dip your vegetables/meat/fishballs in after it's been cooked. I mainly mix Chinese BBQ sauce (sha cha sauce - [https://www.amazon.com/BullHead-Bullhead-Barbecue-Sauce/dp/B003WCA1HK](https://www.amazon.com/BullHead-Bullhead-Barbecue-Sauce/dp/B003WCA1HK)) with some soy sauce, sesame oil, and tons of minced scallions and garlic.",1

We discovered last week when making rice noodles the first time that a turkey roasting pan with lid made a pretty good ad hoc steaming pan. Knew there was a reason I hadn’t gotten rid of that thing!,1
"Shit, man. Stay safe.",1
I’ll check the brand next time I go to store. I’m in lockdown due to arctic weather conditions.,1
I have seen vendor making it but never tried myself. It looks so easy the way you described it.,1
“Guojian?” It’s guo nian (过年).,1
Correct! I use water and a rack and tray! And use the lid of the griddle thingy close it to steam it,1
"OH. I see it now. d'oh. So instead of grilling you just did water layer, rack and tray?

Interesting. I feel like a lot of guides often involve much more elaborate set up, but this definitely feels much more my speed.",1
That’s a cool hack,1
I don’t know but I don’t like it. I just found a place that delivers to my office that has brown fried rice. So happy.,1

here most of them are very idk how to say it but old",1
I never would have thought to use the lid as a steamer tray 😂. I like that idea,1

"As we started steaming? 1 hour for 4 adults 

Don't make it too thick and it should be quite fast. (Feed as soon as possible tho so whoever is making it eats last lol)",1
How long did this take to make? My mom and I did it and it took all day to get enough for everyone (4 adults) to eat.,1
Maybe they mix eggs or just egg yolks on the rice before putting on the pan to make it yellow,1
It's surprising how often this debate comes up! when I was initially reading more about it I discovered this video which I thought was pretty interesting https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTEaFuNbbsM,1
"Looks fun!

^(Get it?)",1
"Yeah! I had no idea they used so much oil until I looked up recipes. That's an interesting way to remove the moisture. 

I've usually done the salting method, letting it sit and patting it dry, but yours is much faster. :)",1
"Looks great. Glad to see other people trying to make healthier variations of this, I love Chinese style eggplant dishes but am a bit put off deep frying it every time to get a nice texture, but I found putting your eggplant slices on a paper towel in the microwave  for 5 minutes is also a good way to extract a lot of the moisture and makes it softer, after that I basically just stir fry it and it's pretty nice",1
Are you my alter ego? I'm so stoked to finally meet you!,1
"Chinese eggplant is more elongated, brighter purple and has thinner skin. The seeds are smaller and it seems more mild and tender. I used to think that they were baby regular eggplant. I also think that the emoji 🍆 is supposed to be the Chinese version.",1
Interesting thank you!,1
"My theory is that they add some chicken bouillon for its MSG content but so they can say “they don’t add MSG”. I don’t have a problem with MSG really, but it would be a convenient workaround.",1
"This looks delicious and healthy! What's the difference between Chinese Eggplant and other eggplant? Your recipe is interesting! I make eggplant with different recipes every time! This time, I'm definitely trying your recipe of Chinese Eggplant!",1
"Here you go! Made this in an Instant Pot because I feel like that's how to get the eggplant softer without using too much oil and without getting it to soggy. 

## Equipment

* Pressure cooker

## Ingredients

* 2 long Chinese eggplants
* Coarse salt
* ½ lb (220 grams) ground meat (beef, turkey or pork)
* 2 scallions chopped
* 2 slices ginger
* 3 cloves garlic minced
* 2 Thai chillis chopped
* 1 tbsp doubanjiang (broad bean sauce)
* ½ tbsp dark soy sauce
* 1 tbsp light soy sauce
* 1 tbsp dark vinegar
* 1 tbsp sesame oil
* 1 tbsp granulated sugar
* 1 tbsp cornstarch
* 1 cup water
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil

## Instructions

* Slice eggplant into 4 inch/10 cm stalks. Sprinkle with coarse salt and let it sit for 30 minutes. You'll see the eggplant ""sweat."" Pat dry.
* Chop and dice your garlic, scallions, ginger, and Thai chillis. Set aside.
* Make your sauce by mixing the dark and light soy sauces, vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, cornstarch, and water. Mix well.
* Set Instant Pot to Saute. Heat up 1 tbsp of oil. If you are making protein, cook the meat until brown. Add in the garlic, scallions, ginger, and Thai chillis and stir for 1 minute until fragrant.
* Add in 1 tbsp of the broad bean sauce, stir for 1 minute.
* Add in your eggplant and pour in the sauce. Mix until everything is coated evenly.
* Set Instant Pot to High Pressure and cook for 6 minutes. Let Natural Release for 5, and then Quick Release.
* Serve over rice.",1
Looks yummy.  What was your recipe?,1
Ooh great tip! Will try that next weekend :),1
"Looking at some methods online, I've seen a good tip of first using hot water to mix the flour and then adding room temp water. That way some of the dough cooks and makes it easier to roll out!",1

Interesting way to fold them!,1
The shape doesn't look like a typical dumpling. No offense.,1
"Wontons are in a sense a type of dumpling. Wontons are usually smaller than other dumplings and filled with meat and aromatics but not vegetables (you wouldn’t really put chive in a wonton), they are usually twisted and served boiled and in broth. And as the other user posted, the wrapper might have egg in it, although that’s not always true. 

Dumplings can take lots of different forms, the type shown here is really not very traditional shape wise. Usually they are crescent shaped and folded with pleats. They often do contain a meat as well as a vegetable such as chive or cabbage. They can be boiled, steamed, or pan fried.",1
Oh my god that looks unreal!!,1
"Ahh I didn’t know about the egg aspect, but I was aware of the shape, which added to my confusion when I saw this post. 

Thanks 😊",1
Wonton wrappers usually contain egg which gives them a different taste and texture. They're also square whereas dumplings are usually round.,1
Awesome,1
"As someone who made wontons a few days back, and look extremely similar, can you explain the difference?

It’s a running joke I have with my husband because he doesn’t like dumplings but likes wontons and I have found the fillings to be interchangeable, and the wrapper process is identical( from what I can find)",1

"I have been working on a recipe to make my own version of Lao Gan Ma that's both more spicy and less salty than the store brand.  I'm finally getting close, this time was the first batch that's ""eat it out of the jar with a spoon"" good.  Your choice of chile flakes is important for the flavor, I used a combination of deseeded Thai chiles, Korean  gochugaru, and a combination of habaneros and Fresnos with garlic that was fermented for a few weeks and dried.  Recipe is as follows:

32g red chile flakes

25g sesame seeds

1 1/4 cup vegetable oil

1 1/2 tbsp fermented black beans

2 tsp msg

1 1/2 tsp salt

1 tsp sugar

6 tbsp crispy fried shallots

Combine the chile flakes and sesame seeds.  Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat and add chiles and sesame seeds.  Toast for 3-5 minutes, stirring constantly, until you can smell a strong roasted aroma and the chiles have darkened.  Add oil to pan and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until you have reached the desired taste, another 3-5 minutes more.  Meanwhile, pulse the rest of the ingredients in a food processor until finely-textured.  Stir in the remaining ingredients, remove from the heat, and allow it to cool in the pan.

Notes: Be very careful cooking the chiles, it's easy to scorch them and turn them bitter.  Taste often and err on the side of taking it off the heat early.  It's really close to Lao Gan Ma but has a better toasted chile flavor and a hint of caramel from adding the sugar to the hot oil.  It needs more fried shallots, but I ran out.  The sesame seeds could have benefitted from a longer toast, next time I'm going to add them to the pan for a minute or two before adding the chile flakes.  I also liked the flavor I got from simmering star anise and ginger in the oil first from the recipe at The Woks of Life, I'm going to do that first next time.",1

"The recipe would depend on the flavor you can accept. 

 fried bean curd （if you can't buy this can use the plate toufu） 1/2 cup cornstarch, 1 stick of chopped green onion, filling: 1 teaspoon, 1/2 patties of ground meat, 2 mushrooms, 1 green onion, 2 slices of ginger, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, 3/2 tsp soy sauce, 3 tbsp oyster sauce, 3 tbsp soy sauce, 3/2 cup water, 1 tsp monosodium glutamate, 1 tsp salt, 3/2 tbsp cornstarch, 1 tbsp sugar. Mix all the fillings well; mix all the seasonings well and set aside.

2. After washing the tofu, cut into 4×7cm blocks( if you can buy the fired bead curd, dig one hole directly)  dig a hole in the middle (about 2cm deep, not deep to the bottom layer) with a spoon, and smear a layer of cornstarch (to strengthen the viscosity) in the cavity, Fill the stuffing mixed in method 1 (it is better to make the stuffing bulge more beautiful), and then apply a layer of cornstarch (it will appear smoother after frying), and finally put it in a 150°C oil pan Fry for about 2 minutes until the surface is golden brown, and drain the oil for later use.

&amp;#x200B;

3. In a separate oil pan, sauté the chopped green onions, pour the seasonings mixed in Method 1 and bring to a boil, then put in Method 2 tofu, and cook on medium heat for about 3 minutes",1

"The red envelope is called 'lai see' or 'hong bao'. They are kind of the equivalent of a card with money but there are some rules on different special occasions. The most common being lunar new year.

During lunar new year they symbolise basically how good your life is so married people will give them out. The more money in them the more prosperity/closer relationship you have. As you go to visit family you wish them happy new year and say a number of different phrases then they give you envelopes. Most people also give envelopes to their doorman, cleaners, building staff etc. 

In terms of ettiquite, ideally the money should be crisp new notes. Here we make a booking with the bank to get new notes, but at the end of the day most of the younger generation aren't fazed. Also important is that you should always give and receive any gift, business card or red packet with 2 hands to show you are thoughtful about it!

Really simple dish I made to use up some leftover pumpkin. Next time I would use more pumpkin and sub lap cheong or bacon for the pork to bump up the flavour. Easy one pot meal that's pretty healthy too. Oh and happy New year to everyone who celebrates!,1
"shengjian bao, yup!",1
"Dumplings are always so finnicky. Keep at it, it takes practice!",1
"Tried making these last week, and utterly failed.",1
"Happy new year, keep feasting!",1
Happy 牛year to you too!,1
"Thanks, I thought that looked like a pork hock or similar.",1
xin nian kuai le !,1
So my local supermarket have self-heating hot pot too and everyone complaint the meat is completely different than what's advertised. As it turns out they can't import the ones with meat in it so they have to substitute with something from the US.,1
"I find this very confusing and I am unsure what falls into each of your regions. Like would Shanghainese food be South of Beijing or West China? 

Might be helpful if you give more context. I wasn't sure how to answer this at all.",1
Looks like braised pigs feet with shitake mushrooms.,1
"Gong xi fa cai, everyone!  That spread looks amazing!  So jealous!  I decided to restart a low-carb weihht loss diet again on NYE.  Sigh... Silly me...",1
"Happy Chinese New year to you as well! On this occasion of Chinese New year, I have made Chicken Manchow Noodles and Szechuan Beef with these recipes!

"Thanks, that is what I do when I hand chop meat for ground meat dishes, but I have never done it otherwise and I can see how it would help a lot.",1
I think it depends on what type.  For water spinach typically you use a fermented bean curd and some garlic to stir fry with it.  Gail lan usually just boil until it's the tenderness you like then dress with oyster sauce and some heated oil.,1
"That's the one thing that is confusing for me about shopping for these types of products if you don't know how to read Chinese--they all say ""pickled vegetable"" but mean different vegetables and different ways of preparation.",1
"I have never heard of the cut pork cushion, so I looked it up.  I usually use pork butt though for char siu when I made it.  [https://www.smokedbbqsource.com/what-is-pork-cushion/](https://www.smokedbbqsource.com/what-is-pork-cushion/)",1
Happy new year! Is that top dish black moss and some other mushrooms? It looks absolutely delicious.,1
Happy New Year!,1
Happy New Year!Looks delicious 👍,1
Happy New Year !Enjoy the nice food 👍,1
Happy New Year !Looks very beautiful and delicious 👍,1
Ginger scallion lobster is my favorite,1
Absolutely beautiful,1
Looks so good. I wish I had dumplings right now.,1
Can I come over?!?!,1
Happy New Year 🧧,1
Yup. Thanks.,1
Looks very good! Did you make it?,1
Anyone looking for this in the Phoenix metro area should go check out Shaanxi Garden in Tempe/Mesa. Definitely a favorite of mine 😋,1
Please please share her recipe.  That looks amazing and it is with beef.  Most of the recipes online are non-meat.,1
Gong Xi Fa Cai!,1
"Aren't these called pan-fried buns(生煎包)? Either way, they look really tasty!",1
"These are pulled noodles, correct?

Looks amazing!",1
"Yeah, just peel and eat",1

"A point of pride of mine as a child that I could write it. Okay, who am I kidding, I'm still proud.",1
what I miss most since leaving home :’) I’ve tried making it too but somehow it just doesn’t taste the same,1
"So that most people can answer. Ex: Sichuan food is known as being very spicy and is famous even in the U.S. and Canada. But, most people don't eat only food from there all the time. Some people can't handle only spiciness, but eat other food from Sichuan still. Maybe they have a wife from neighbour provinces like Xizang or something. Then, they would have to pick ""all China/mix"" instead of ""West China"". But, if we had North of Beijing for Manchuria, South China for Hong Kong region, etc., more people would choose accurately.",1
"Yep, I think they are mustard greens and chillies, super good.",1
Interesting. Does it say what vegetables are in it? Probably really good with poached fish,1
"I tried them with rice and they are super spicy! They are similar to something like Laoganma + Kimchi, super good",1
I like pickled vegetables in fried rice.  It adds a nice acidic crunch.,1
[deleted],1
"Try A Bite of China on Youtube. Flavourful Origins is made by the same guy, but A Bite of China has longer episodes on a single theme.",1
Yes you can! I don't think I've ever eaten them cooked except in fried rice.,1
"Well, I'll try tonight, if it doesn't end well I'll down it with some rice lol",1
"Not really... Yacai is preserved, dry, funky. This is a pickled vegetable in chili oil which is pretty different.  Worth a try and maybe a substitute but probably not comparable.",1
You should definitely try lotus seed filling next! It’s also pretty common as a mooncake filling. My absolute favorite :),1
Quite a complicated Chinese character for biang.  The noodles are tasty though.  I like to have a rou jia mo with these.,1
"Thank you, I will try to google them because I don't speak chinese :) but I love the food. I am watching the series ""flavorful origins"" on netflix right now, it is amazing!",1
Hot pot is my favourite!!😋😋,1

I really miss those big family spreads. My family been eating a lot of hot pot lately tho,1
No worries! 420g flour makes a lot more sense then 😁,1
Gosh! I checked the video again it actually is 420g not 240g. It is a typo I made in the description above. So embarassing! Thank you for pointing it out. I was so wrong😹,1
"The way I calculate hydration is called baker's percentage (https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/pro/reference/bakers-percentage) where the total amount of flour is the base, and any ingredients you add to the the flour to form the dough is a percentage of the flour. So following your recipe, 210ml water = 210g, and the flour is 240g, so the hydration in terms of baker's percentage would be 210/240. Obviously you can use a different way to calculate hydration if that's how you usually do it.

But in any case, if that much water works for you, that's great. But I know personally for me, for 240g flour (no matter the type of flour), if I use a lot more than 120g water, the dough is typically too sticky and unmanageable.",1
Yum!! Happy Chinese new year!!,1
太好了！,1
新年快乐!,1
"Next time, semi-freeze the beef for 30-60 minutes. You can slice it super thin that way.",1
Why not use the cuisines names instead of N/S/E/W?,1
May I please be invited to your house for dinner?? :),1
wow! that's a good CNY Eve feast!,1
"Hmm, this looks delicious. I'm jealous 😭",1
Looks so good!! Could you tell me the name of the dishes?,1
That looks very good.,1
"Looooong noodles, happy new year :)",1
"Thats not how you calculate hydration (i made that mistake before😂)

Hydration ratio = water / (water+flour)= 210/(210+240)=46%. 
Dumpling wrappers should be 45-50% hydration (depends on your flour obviously)

Btw it is 210ml on 240g, not the other way round",1
You made this? That's awesome!,1
"Celery. I would imagine if you can get your hands on celtuce, that would be even better.",1
Well worth buying. I own all of her books and I cook out of Food of Sichuan and Every Grain of Rice more than the rest. Every Grain of Rice is great because it's a sampling of recipes from different regions (though I would say Sichuan heavy) and the dishes are very satisfying in their simplicity and perfect for weeknights.,1

Fuchsia Dunlop’s recipe in The Food of Sichuan,1

How do you make the dough,1
"Sichuan peppercorns may be an acquired taste. They are actually meant to temper intense spice. So if you cut back the heat, I would also scale back the peppercorns a bit.",1
Mashed potatoes for the shrimp to go over. Branches are 紫菜 a type of seaweed (really good in soup). Kind of like Japanese nori.,1
"My fiancé spent most of his life in China and he refuses these completely. He says too much of the container is the self-heating device and they don’t come with enough food. We have a powered hot pot that plugs in to the wall and another burner that heats up for a split hot pot, so we can cook any kind of meat or seafood we can buy. I guess we really don’t need any more hot pots, haha. They’re probably useful for people without a lot of appliances.

Anyone in Arizona can get them from the Asian snack shops around ASU. We’ve seen them at the general Asian grocery stores but half the Asian grocery stores here are Korean and they don’t have them there.",1
i saw these instant hot pot kits in the store the other day. are they any good?,1
"The taste is what’s important, at least to me.",1
::falling to knees:: Nnnnnnoooooooooo!!!!!!!,1
It looks like the flowers are made of corn. The streamers and caps are carrot. What are the branches?,1

Not sure if prawns can retain large amount of water. You can try the recipe with chicken mince. Be sure to have sufficient fat content %,1
Yes! I'm in AZ and we can buy these at most asian markets. They're about $10-$15 each depending. Our favorite brand is HaiDiLao!,1
How do they get the lid to not fog up???,1
Any idea on whether the water ratio applies when using only prawns? My family is Muslim unfortunately.,1
Are those baked? Takes forever to fry them.,1
Let me know if its good!,1

Thanks :),1
This is an awesome vid!,1
Awesome video,1
"Lol, it kind of gave me a new respect for Vienna sausages....it was tasty!",1
"True — not that my ability to read Chinese would have extended far enough to read it anyway lol 

It was just a surprise to see something so familiar inside, though it ended up working just great all together, spicy and yummy!",1

"INGREDIENTS

~25 pieces of large dumplings | 5-6 pieces per person

⚫ Dumpling skin dough 

Plain flour 240g

Boiling water 210ml

⚫ Dumpling filling

Minced pork 250g (At least 20% fat content)

Boiling water 150g

Sliced ginger 10g

Spring onion 10g

Sichuan peppercorn 10g (optional)

Sea salt 1/2 tsp

Grated ginger 1tsp

Light soya sauce 2tsp

White pepper powder 1/2 tsp

Napa cabbage (US) / Chinese Leaf (UK) 250g



STEPS:

1)	Dumpling dough: Add boiling water to flour and mix with chopsticks. When the water is fully absorbed, use your hands to knead the dough till the dough surface is smooth

2)	Cover with cling film and rest for 30 min

3)	Prepare filling: Dice cabbage

4)	Add salt to wilt the cabbage for 30 mins

5)	Steep ginger, spring onion and Sichuan peppercorn in boiling water for 20 mins. Drain and reserve the liquid

6)	Stir in liquid into meat in one direction. Add the salt, white pepper, grated ginger and soya sauce

7)	Rest the meat in the fridge for 30 mins

8)	Make dumpling wrappers: Dust the working surface with flour. Cut the dough into 2 halves. Wrap the other half in cling film to avoid drying out

9)	Roll the dough into a long shape. Cut the dough into pieces that each weighs 25g

10)	Press with your palm, with the cut opening facing down

11)	Use a rolling pin to apply even pressure to all sides to form a 10cm diameter disc

12)	Assemble dumplings: Add cabbage to meat filling right before folding dumplings

13)	Place 25g of filling onto the centre of the wrapper

14)	Wipe half of the rim with water. Take the dry side and fold onto the wet side. Seal the rim with pressure. Seal the 2 sides with 3 fingers

15)	Storage: Place dumplings on baking paper dusted with flour. Dust the dumplings with flour as well. If not served immediately, store in freezer. They can be stored for 3 months",1
"FAQ (5/5): How can I avoid having too much meat filling or wrapper dough left? How can I make uniform dumplings?

•	Weigh the dough and meat you use for each dumpling. Each dumpling of my recipe is made of 25g wrapper dough and 25g meat per dumpling. This 1:1 ratio is easy to seal while not having too much dough

•	Measure the diameter of the wrapper (I use 10cm)

•	Uniform weight + uniform diameter = uniform wrapper thickness

•	Uniform dumpling wrapper + uniform amount of filling = uniform dumplings",1
"FAQ (4/5): How should I store the dumplings?
- NEVER place the freshly made dumplings on a surface that is not dusted with flour (e.g. a plate / freezer bag). It will stick to the surface. 
- Best practice: Place freshly made dumplings on baking paper dusted with flour, and dust the dumplings with flour. Store in freezer. Once they are frozen, you are safe to throw them into freezer bags. They can be stored for 3 months in freezer
- Do not store above 0°C. Otherwise moisture from the filling will turn wrappers sticky
- DO NOT THAW before cooking for the same reason",1
"FAQ (3/5): Should I use hot or cold water for Dumpling wrapper dough?
- Hot water gelatinises the starch in flour, which inhibits gluten formation. This makes the dough softer. It is more suitable for steamed and potstickers (pan fried dumplings)
- Use cold water dough to make tougher wrappers for boiled dumplings",1
"FAQ (2/5) How can I avoid the filling releasing a pool of liquid?
- You need to salt wilt the napa cabbage (US) / Chinese leaf (UK), and squeeze the water out
- Do not add the cabbage into the meat until you are really ready to fold the dumplings. Otherwise the cabbage will release a pool of extra liquid into the meat, making it difficult to manage",1
"FAQ 1: How do I make super juicy meat filling?
- First step is to choose the right pork - get at least 20% fat
- Then you need to let the meat absorb a lot of liquid (The step is called '打水', literally beat the liquid into the meat). You'll be surprised how much water the meat can hold - I use a pork-to-liquid ratio of 2:1
- 2 critical steps to help meat retain liquid: (1) Stir in one direction to form a gelatinised network that holds the moisture (2) Add Salt to enhance water holding capacity of the meat",1

Yay! Have you heard of “[dì sān xiān](https://youtu.be/Uwh0HAs-Rsg)” before? It’s a northeastern China dish (with aubergine as one of the main ingredients) and my husband (a white boy born and raised in the great Midwest in US) loves it. I’ve heard many expat friends mentioning how much they loved it too.,1

Always haha,1
"I also know people who don't like garlic, including my own wife :-) But as a garlic-lover myself I always prefer it cut into very small pieces, I think it releases much more flavor and you can also eat it (whereas it's unpleasant to eat large chunks of it). But life is full of compromises, isn't it ;-)",1
Looks amazing!,1
"Yeah it’s definitely interesting to observe — once I told my (British) friend I don’t chop garlic too small so that ppl who don’t like garlic can pick it out and he was like “who doesn’t like garlic”, whereas I, growing up in China, have met quite a few ppl who disliked garlic.",1
"he found this image on the inter webs i believe. There is no way he made 4 pizzas, got a dog, made soup, and did this in one day.",1
The variety of seafood makes me so happy. And chicken feet.,1
I live in China so I'd never heard the “garlic sauce” appellation. Makes sense: probably that eggplant cooked like a fish doesn't sound super appealing to the average american customer ;-),1
I hated eggplants growing up — this is how my mom got me to eat eggplants haha,1
Love that!,1
"Yeah I get that — trying very hard to get the blog together right now. And I totally get it if you don’t like the crunch, even tho I’m a big fan of varieties in texture for my foods.",1
"It’s actually named 鱼香 because the flavors came from a typical flavor combo that was originally used to cook fish, you know, to cover the unpleasant fishiness. But somehow the smart Chinese restauranteurs introduced it as “garlic sauce” to the US and got much better market adoption than it probably would have if introduced as fishy eggplants or fish-fragrant eggplants.",1

This is really one of my favourites. Saw [this one](https://youtu.be/4uU6DwAi2S8) on YouTube by Fuchsia Dunlop. Bought the book.,1
"Ah yeah, this trick. I've tried it before but wasn't really satisfied with that either because it added some ""crisp"" to it that I didn't care for, but I've only done it once.

I've been relatively disconnected from Chinese culture for the past several years, leading to less motivation to cook Chinese food, so I've really been missing out on my favorites.

I'll give your tip another try. I probably just used too much or something.

I might check out your video! Tbh I'm not fond of videos -- they take so much time to watch and make it difficult to multitask, I'd rather read a blog post about the recipe.",1
"No, the either stuff, at the bottom, it looks like mantis shrimp or an isopod",1
"I'm not familiar with that brand and unfortunately the picture doesn't indicate use case in Chinese. What filling did you try to use? These work well with a sturdier wonton wrapper (recipe from my small food blog)
https://www.thericelover.com/shanghai-beef-wonton/
I did beef in the recipe for some friends who keep kosher, but pork would be more traditional.",1
Patiently waiting for the recipe. Looks great!,1
Not to hijack OP's beautiful eggplant dish but I steam cut eggplants tossed in a dash of cornstarch and white vinegar.,1
I actually plan to talk about just that!!! Trick is to coat eggplants with starch before frying and drain oil with paper towel before stir frying. (Oops I hope you are still interested enough to watch the video later 😂),1
"can you give me the trick to minimize the oil used for cooking the eggplants?

I can cook bomb 鱼香茄子 but it always comes out too too oily. It'd be perfect otherwise. I've tried reducing the oil but the eggplants get a tougher texture instead of smooth and buttery. Is it just a balancing act?",1
Beautiful photo!  I bet it tasted great :),1
Great thinking! Hehe,1

"So it’s actually [these guys](https://fsiseattle.com/products/rose-brand-wrapper-wonton-medium-50-1-lb/). I bought 2 packs and tried to make siu mai with the first - it did not turn out great. I might try to roll them actually, but I wanted to check that there wasn’t some thick dumpling-skin application I wasn’t familiar with out there.",1
I was going to recommend The Woks of Life recipe too! One of my absolute favorite blogs/websites.,1
"Could you upload a picture of the label?

If they're too thick for the kind you have in mind, you might be able to just roll them thinner. Small wontons (usually plain meat, or meat + seafood filling) uses thin wispy wonton wrappers, while big meat + veg wontons are usually thicker skinned. That said, I've had American Chinese food takeout wontons that have such thick skins I can't imagine any reasonable use case for.

The brand I usually buy is 真味 Twin Marquis. It's widely available and quite authentic.",1

"Welcoming Lunar New Year / Year of the Ox with Chinese Radish Cake (lo bak go/luo bo gao)!

Lunar New Year is just around the corner, and we're about to welcome the Year of the Ox! One of the dishes we always enjoyed at home growing up around Chinese New Year was my grandma's delicious homemade Chinese radish cake, also known as turnip cake/lo bak go/luo bo gao/dim sum radish cake!

While this is a popular and ubiquitous dish on dim sum/yum cha carts around the globe, it's also an auspicious dish to eat around the Lunar New Year period because the word ""cake"" in Chinese is a homonym for ""high/tall,"" meaning that if you eat this in the new year, you will have a high, prosperous new year!

The best Chinese radish cakes are stuffed to the brim with grated radish (duh), Chinese bacon, scallops, shrimp, and shiitake mushrooms, then steamed, and finally sliced thick and pan-fried to golden, crispy perfection. My biggest gripe when getting Chinese radish cake at restaurants during dim sum feasts is that there's rarely enough radish or delicious fillings in them. But you can control all of that when you make it yourself!

To watch my step-by-step video on how to make this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi2ySRE4Zq4&amp;t=47s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi2ySRE4Zq4&amp;t=47s)

**Chinese Turnip Cake Recipe**  


* 2 lb Chinese turnip/radish/daikon, grated (yield: about 5 C); (reserve 1 C cooking liquid)
* 1 C finely minced Chinese bacon or sausage
* 4 dried Chinese scallops, shredded; rehydrated in 1/4 C water, soaking liquid reserved
* 1/4 C (scant) dried shrimp, finely minced; rehydrated in 1/4 C water, soaking liquid reserved
* 8-9 dried shiitake mushrooms, minced; rehydrated in 1/2 C water, soaking liquid reserved
* 2 scallions, roughly chopped
* 2 C rice flour
* 1.5 tsp kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp white pepper
* 1 tsp sugar
* 2 tsp shaoxing wine 
* Neutral oil (for pan frying slices) 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Prepare Chinese bacon:** cut into a few large pieces and steam over medium heat until cooked through. Cool throughly. Remove the fat layer and mince finely. Set aside. 
2. **Prepare scallops, dried shrimp, and mushrooms:** soak the scallops in 1/4 C water, the shrimp in 1/4 C water, and the mushrooms in 1/4 C water to rehydrate. This should take a few hours. Once rehydrated, reserve the soaking liquids for each. Then, finely mince mushrooms and shrimp. For the scallops, shred with your fingers into thread-like pieces. 
3. **Prepare Chinese turnip:** wash, peel, and grate the turnip. After grating, you should have between 4.5-5.5 C turnip. Add this to a pot with 4 C water; bring to a boil over medium heat and simmer for 30 min. Drain this, reserving 1 C cooking liquid. Set aside. 
4. **Prepare turnip filling:** Add bacon to a large pot over medium heat; stir fry until sizzling and fragrant. Then, add the scallops, shrimp, and mushrooms, and stir fry until slightly browned. Finally, add in the scallions and shaoxing wine, stir fry for another minute or two, and remove from heat.
5. **Prepare rice flour base and create cake mixture**: Add rice flour, all soaking liquids, the turnip cooking liquid, plus the salt, pepper, and sugar to a mixing bowl and mix until fully incorporated. Then, add this mixture to the pot with the radish mixture; mix until fully combined. Then, add this mixture into a greased 8-9in cake pan. If using a springform pan, line with foil to prevent leakage or water from getting in.
6. **Steam cake:** Prepare steamer and allow to come to a boil. Add cake to steamer, and steam for 1 hour, replenishing water when necessary.
7. **Cool, slice, and pan fry:** Fully cool cake for at min 5 hours, or ideally overnight in fridge. Cut the cake into slices Chinese style (see video for guide). Pan fry with neutral oil on both sides. Garnish with scallions or cilantro (optional).",1
"First of all, depending on the regions or even the family you’re from, hong shao rou and lu rou might both have their own different versions. 

Lu rou for Taiwanese is a braised pork mince, for instance. 

From my own understanding and experience, hong shao rou starts with the searing of the pork. Then you add in soy sauce, sugar, spices etc. The pork is braised in that sauce as you create the dish. The sauce needs to end up thick and glossy, and is only for that dish. 

Lu rou uses the technique Lu, which is also the name of the brine/sauce that the pork is cooked in. The pork is first blanched, before putting in an existing Lu brine for flavour infusion. A good Lu brine will be recycled and restored, even cherished and passed down through generations. But of course you can use a one-time Lu brine, only the flavour won’t be as intense as an old one.",1

"Good wontons or dumplings don't need a binder. The myosin in the meat will naturally produce the springy mouth feel. Just add some water/stock and stir vigorously for several minutes until sticky. You can also use the paddle attachment on a stand mixer. Most people don't stir meat filling enough.

These use beef, but the same principal applies with pork: https://www.thericelover.com/shanghai-beef-wonton/",1

"Thank you! I have a recipe for hong shao rou on my blog as well -- I cut the cooking time (and free up a stove slot) with an Instant Pot / electric pressure cooker. You could definitely cut some of the salt and soy sauce out and still get a very good product. It sounded to me like the sodium is a medical condition vs the sugar is a diet, so I'm glad it was a helpful suggestion.

I definitely look forward to hear what you decide on! Chinese cooking is really varied, but coming up with ideas for different dietary restrictions is always hard to me simply because I can't think of all the possibilities.",1

"I only just got the Food of Sichuan and it's my only book from her, but I've been following Fuchsia Dunlop for a few years now and she's lovely. Very eloquent in her writing and the book is absolutely wonderful.

Is the book good? Have been looking at buying Every Grain of Rice for a while.,1
Sheng jian bao is probably my favorite thing from Shanghai. Don't tell my friend. Though she might agree.,1
"I think hong shao rou would be very well received by anyone who eats pork. I've had friends make it with beef (recommend boneless short ribs) to great success as well, but it comes out a little darker. It could be tough to do both as low sodium and no carb though. Most hong shao rou recipes include a lot of soy sauce. The traditional method is to use caramel 糖色 which removes some of the sodium while looking and tasting better.

If they eat lamb, cumin lamb would be nice! Meets all the dietary restrictions, and skewers are universal. If you steam a fish, I'd skip the head and tail. Go with a white fish filet, flounder or sea bass would be great choices.

Low carb, no sugar, and you can customize the amount of salt. For veggies, smashed cucumber salad is wonderful and universally appealing. And then I think although tofu may not be a familiar food, a home-style braised tofu is actually very appealing and uses no ""weird sauces"". My recipe is here, it's very mild: [https://www.thericelover.com/home-style-tofu/](https://www.thericelover.com/home-style-tofu/)",1
I made this for my mums birthday the other day from the Dunlop book. Really enjoyed!,1
" This tofu is quick and easy to make, gluten-free, perfectly seasoned, and is crispy on the outside, and moist in the middle!  What makes the tofu crispy?  There are 2 things that you must do to get your tofu cooked perfectly crispy...  Coat it in cornstarch!  This is a key component to making a crispy outer layer over your tofu.  You can also add any spices or seasoning to the cornstarch to flavor it. Fry your tofu! Frying your tofu in oil at the correct temperature (370° F) will make a delicious crispy coating that's not sticky or greasy.  If you fry your tofu at too low of a temperature, it will soak up more oil and get soggy.",1

"Hi! First things first, thanks so much for the sub!

And what you are asking is a super intelligent question that inspired me to start doing this – my true nature as a big-time nerd really wants to build a mind map and spend months working out a narrative and produce an hour-long video rambling about the thoughts behind the amazing flavors and textures of all 8 major Chinese cuisines. 

Altho I can’t do that quite yet. On one hand, since I am only very recently someone who spends the majority of time talking about cooking, I still have a lot of synthesizing to do before I can comprehensively and concisely communicate the essence of something that sorta became a second nature to me through pure passion and practice. On the other, as a baby content creator I simply don’t have enough time and energy to allocate to a massive production like that while trying to build the groundwork. So I try to carry a little bit of rambling in every narrated recipe walk-thru video, hoping the practical side of recipe videos would generate more interest while building some reference points for when I do have the time and energy to make a longer video on thought processes and methodologies. 

Also, I’m so, so glad you brought this up – now I know the kind of videos that I dream to make will be watched by at least one fellow cooking addict!",1

"I am apparently using the Guizhou method although with Sichuan spices, I followed the recipe from The Woks of Life.  I've done the Sichuan method before, it had great flavor but I don't remember how the texture compares.  I'm going to do the Sichuan method next time, I thought that simmering the spices in the oil was a waste because they were overpowered by the other strong flavors.  If anything I would add powdered spices after I've poured the oil over the chile flakes.  After toasting the flakes I added a bunch of crispy fried shallots, some fermented black beans, ground Sichuan peppercorns, and a little MSG.  It's good, but not ""eat it out of the jar with a spoon"" good like Lao Gan Ma is.",1
Have you tried posting on r/translator,1
Then crossed with dietary restrictions from different religious practices you’ve got so many different fusions.  Take me back to Penang,1
No worries :) glad you enjoyed the food here.,1
"I’ve been trying this too, both the Chinese Cooking Demystified and the Serious Eats recipes. 
The taste is really good but I’m not 100% on the crunchy texture yet, are you going the Sichuan route (pouring hot oil over toasted chilli flakes) or the Guizhou one, home place of Laoganma (frying the chilli flakes in hot oil)? 
I’d be really interested to hear. The Guizhou method is supposed to make it crunchier, but I’m doing something wrong (frying at too low heat? Under toasting?) as it’s coming out even a bit gummy/sauce like after it’s sat for a while.",1
You should try again as I tried it a few times and it's sooooo varied everywhere. Its like a national dish but every stall and persons lassa was a different recipe which made it more wonderful and exciting. You may just come across one that u like. 😊,1
"Period.... or full stop, as we say I'm Britain. 😅 You are right, it's so diverse and I was fascinated by the natural mixture of cuisines between the Indian, Malaysian and Chinese culinary creations!",1
"Thanks for specifying. I am not an expert on the origins of each dish as I myself am British and I also just wanted to showcase my satisfying and delicious montage. I was aware that some dishes aren't Chinese but nonetheless just wanted to share my wonderful food memories.

"I'm working on a recipe for a homemade version of Lao Gan Ma chile crisp that's both more spicy and less salty.  I've almost got it there, the toasted chile flavor is much stronger but unfortunately I scorched my chiles a bit so it's slightly bitter.  I'm still working on the timing of cooking them with the oil.",1
Mind sharing the recipe for the fermented bean chili oil?,1
"It is so much better, and I like tinkering with it. If you like Laoganma, then I recommend trying a homemade one. The taste is amazing.",1
"Oh yes, I love the numbing. I have used the red peppercorns for huajiaoyou before, but this is my first try with the green ones (I have bought a bottle of the green huajiaoyou, before but it tasted old or a bit rancid).",1

"Macau is a former Portuguese colony so they’re very similar. [The Woks of Life](https://thewoksoflife.com/portuguese-custard-tarts-pasteis-de-nata/) says there are some subtle differences. “Portuguese Custard Tarts (pasteis de nata or pastel de nata) are sweeter, less eggy, and sometimes dusted with cinnamon.”",1
"Highly recommended!!!!! Even more so if you (like me) don’t have access to good Peking duck. Haha. But if you can order it then it’s less needed. It’s a slow process but hopefully given covid we have a little more time these days. Even when my Peking duck comes out as a roast duck it’s still delicious, and then you can use the bone to make duck stock for noodles. Also, I think I failed to dry it properly was because I bought a cheap duck that was frozen and sealed with a lot of liquid, so hopefully you can find a quality butcher that can source a duck that hasn’t been frozen for ever.",1
Good luck! I wish I had the balls to try a whole duck one of these days.. you're an inspiration!,1
"What makes them different from the Portuguese version? I first had these as Macau egg tarts when I lived in China (I was born and raised in china), and later learned that these are originally a Portuguese pastry after I moved out of China. But I don't know how they are different from the Portuguese original as I've never compared the two versions side by side.",1
"Mmm, delicious. I do like a bai cai with slivers of meat. I love to steam a white fleshed fish with ginger and scallions - some how I never thought salmon would give me that flavor profile I crave, but it could be a good compromise! Thank you!",1
"Mmmm all sound so delicious!! Thanks for the great ideas. I like the dong bo and snow pea tips FTW! Yes, I’ve done the Peking duck a few times but even though I’ve dried it out by leaving it in the fridge for a few days, taken out my hair dryer 😹 to blow dry it, it always a little closer to roast duck than I would like lol. Fourth time is the charm though! Still slices very nicely though.",1
"Steamed fish was my first thought, but if you have the skills for a roast/peking duck that's obviously going to be incredible. I feel like sauteed snow pea tips are almost impossible not to like and would be a good veg addition, or the bok choy as suggested.

IMO you also can't go wrong with beef and broccoli, you can do the classic with Chinese broccoli and I think it's a great authentic dish that almost everyone in America would love.

For keto, I bet they would enjoy the dim sum style steamed ribs since it has a similar flavor profile as bulgogi. Or if you want to go max keto how bout one of the braised pork belly dishes, like dong po. :D",1

"Stir-fried tomatoes with eggs is a very common dish that you'll see in every Chinese family's dinner table. It is super basic as it is easy to cook and also very tasty. In terms of cooking, it is a great introduction to Chinese stir frying as it is difficult to mess up.

This dish is rich in protein and anti-oxidants (Vitamins A, C, and K), tastes sweet and sour. In my opinion, it is best served with noodles because it is pretty liquidy. Due to the simplicity of the preparation, most restaurants do not offer this dish lol",1
I want some now!,1

I like the shortbread version with uncaramelized egg tarts.,1
I feel sooo guilty after scoffing these bad boys down. Worst is when you look down and your fingers are covered in that sweet sweet buttery grease.,1
"I think steamed fish is a great idea. Maybe go with something familiar rather than a whole fish like a nice big fillet of salmon. It can be pin-boned so it'll be boneless when served. Simple Cantonese-style would be my pick for this.

I always like nai bai cai as it is great with the contrasting white/green and it's flavor is approachable. If they can eat cabbage they can do nai bai cai (they're both Brassicas). Steamed with slightly thickened chicken broth and slivers of Jinhua ham poured over would be pretty accessible.",1
"Haha this was probably one of the few food items I could order in Cantonese. While I enjoy the HK-shortbread almost version, I have to say this one is my favorite. Lord Stow’s has spoiled me :)",1
Mmm...daan taats! I could easily polish half dozen in one sitting. 😋 I always wanted to try this caramelised version. I'm sure it tastes so nommy!,1

Malaysia is the best place to eat. Period.,1
"This food looks really amazing! I went to Malaysia and I tried many kinds of Malaysian Chinese food. I loved everything but I didn't like Laksa. May be, it wasn't well prepared from where I ate it. It was a poor taste. I hope to eat a good Laksa next time.",1
"I'm guessing a wide wok will allow more product to be fried at one time and keep the oil hotter since more of the cooking vessel is touched by flame.  Also sometimes whole fish are fried in Chinese cooking so a wok for that type of dish would make more sense, although it does not sound like the type of food you are frying.",1
[deleted],1
"You mean the first pic? Nasi goreng pattaya, I wrote about it in my main comment as well.",1
"Nice pix OP and many of these are indeed Malaysian Chinese but some of these really shouldn't be listed as Malaysian Chinese, particularly the first picture which is nasi goreng pattaya. As one might guess from the name, its a Thai-Malay dish with roots in Pattaya. Although it's just a fried rice wrapped in omelette with sauce drizzled over, haha. 

As for laksa, there are Chinese versions of laksa but it's also a dish that Malays and Nyonya make their own versions off so I guess that one's open for interpretation :) Same goes for ice kacang (centre pic) and nasi lemak.",1
"Amazing, never seen anything like that. Google imaging it is pure eye candy

"Specificity definitely isn't our strong point. Like Chinese recipes that all just list the ingredients but the measurements just say 适量 and the instructions are basically ""cook the ingredients so they resemble 'dish name'"" 😂",1
"I do have to say I “reverse engineer” a lot when trying to explain in specific details what certain things mean in Chinese cooking — like for example I measure the temperature of oil when the chopstick is bubbling the right amount, so that I can say “heat canola oil in a nonstick pan to X degrees Fahrenheit”.",1

Ultimately, a chamber is ideal. Koji Alchemy is a good book for builds and recipes. I ended up with a large plastic bin, a fish tank heater, and a fish tank bubbler.  I use a “hotel pan” that sits in there suspended or floating on the water to regulate temp and humidity. I have an inkbird thermostat, but a regular remote thermometer is really all that’s needed. Ended up costing maybe $55 more or less depending on the size of the bin you use. Mine is pretty big so I can do 2 KG batches.",1

"I didn't mean the spelling of Szechuan as much as how many people pronounce it where it doesn't sound anything like Sichuan.

I think every single westerner who visited thought the kung pao chicken was the best, so it blows my mind that it is so hard to find an authentic Sichuan-style one in the States.",1

"My cringes are also food-centric.

1. I cringe when I hear people here in the States say Szechuan instead of Sichuan. I understand it is the old Wade-Giles spelling, but it was always supposed to sound like 四川. 
2. After spending many years in Beijing, I cringe when I hear someone say just ""bao"", I just want to scream ""It's 包子!!!""

But I definitely think stray veggies in kungpao chicken is cringy (it reminds me of something out of Panda Express, so gross). I rarely saw cucumbers in gongbao jiding in Beijing (thank goodness). I encountered something similar to 宫保鸡丁, called jiangbao jiding that had cucumbers, but it wasn't nearly as good as the 宫保鸡丁. The ones I normally ate were very similar to the one in your video (with the exception of the long leeks that were common in Beijing that were about the diameter of a finger)

I was trying to guess how many times I ate 宫保鸡丁 (it was my absolute favorite dish). I ate it several times every week for 12 years in China, so I guess I had it between 2000 and 3000 times. (we had a Sichuan ayi for ten years).",1

"Yunnan food is amazing. Variety is so broad with all the minorities. Cheese, spicy, sour, sweet, salads, steamed, stewed, grilled, fried, etc.  so many delicious things to eat!",1
"I really enjoy Jing (beijing) cuisine. I love spicy foods, and so I like Sichuan style food, but not always into the numbing pepper, and I found I would miss the sweet and nutty tastes I always got in cuisine in Beijing. HK dim sum also always wins in my book.",1
"It does take a whole lot of space especially if you have a ""functional"" (read: not the most spacious, but enough to get everything done) kitchen like ours. I have to admit I never owned a rice cooker until I married my husband, who owns one.",1
"I get it, I lived in Beijing on and off for almost 10 years and I love the Beijing versions of Kung Pao Chicken and Yuxiang pork. I would just call them ""reinvented"" instead of ""authentic"".

And healthy spicy boiled fish? Yeah somebody was totally missing the point... \[joined the silent screaming\]",1
I gon work so hard to keep you my subscriber!,1
Taiwan cabbage and bok choy,1
"I was also worried, to be fair.

I've been searching about it in articles, as well as youtube videos of Chinese people. These two videos inspired me to try it out:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7436g6IZJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7436g6IZJI)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHqU7ERhY1Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHqU7ERhY1Q)

There are also plenty of other videos, that show similar processes with small variations. Sandor Katz also talks about creating starters with plants. And many Asian and African communities have versions of alkaline ferments made with beans that were naturally inoculated by the plants used to store or protect them.

I cooked them as a traditional Chinese sauce/condiment/appetizer. But I haven't eaten it yet, although I made it yesterday. According to many, this appetizer can last even one year on the fridge, so I'll search more and learn more before risking it.

Mainly the reason why I haven't bought koji starters is that where I live they are extremely expensive and hard to find. I'm also afraid that even if I buy it I don't have the right set up to properly ferment it.

Anyways, thank you for your step by step recipe, I'll certainly try it. I still haven't found any literature about it, but the process of inoculating, drying, and then Lacto-fermenting is very similar to how we make fermented tofu. I was wondering if, the Lacto-fermentation process could maybe the beneficial to neutralise even some harmful fungus, considering that both fermented tofu and douchi were, and still are to a certain degree, wild ferments.

Thanks for everything.",1
What’s the green you used? Some kind of cabbage?,1
"I can also understand not getting a rice cooker if you don't regularly cook rice.  Unlike myself, there are people that eat rice only once a month at the most (I average about 3-4 days a week, and only that few because I like to try cooking cuisine from all over the world).  It doesn't make sense for them to get something specific for rice, especially if they know how to cook it on the stove.",1
😂😂😂,1
Cantonese / HK. I love dim sum and HK bbq,1
"So it’s a bit worrisome that you let wild mold grow rather than inoculate with spores, so there is no telling whether you have something desirable that will produce the various protease and lipase enzymes. But I guess it looks OK.  

You want to let the beans ferment to spore. Then sun dry them (or use a dehydrator. 

After that, it’s important to wipe the surface mold spores off. Otherwise it will taste moldy. 

I don’t know about the last step where you cooked them. My understanding is you want them to ferment with brine, ginger, garlic, spices. If you cook them, you kill off beneficial bacteria. Furthermore, high temperatures are going to destroy those enzymes you worked so hard for wit the mold stage, so you won’t get the proteins and fats converting to flavorful compounds. 

1.	Cook beans
2.	Grow mold
3.	dehydrate under sun or however
4.	add salt brine and spices and ferment",1
"Xi'an cuisine. It's not one of the ""great"" cuisines, but there's so much more to it than just biang biang mian and rou jia mo (which are both great - don't get me wrong). It's often but not always spicy, it includes specific local produce, and it uses flour and traditional breads in so many ways. Not to mention that it's a little bit of a melting pot (terminus of the Silk Road), so flavors and cooking techniques from all over China as well as countries to the west pop up in the cuisine.",1
"Can't relate to your kung pao snobbery unfortunately, the hole-in-the-wall neighbourhood place I grew up eating at in Beijing always put cucumbers in it. XD I understand that's not how it's done it Sichuan but it's sadly trained me into developing a taste for it.

But I will share that I recently came across a spicy boiled fish recipe that only had 1 TB of oil in the whole thing. To make it healthier. Silent screaming",1
Taiwanese. I have a sweet palette and love me some sugar. Taiwanese probably skews sweetest out of most Chinese cuisines.,1
 That looks incredible!,1
I try very hard not to be judge-y about food because I do think great food should be an indiscriminately accessible thing -- but I have been called snobbish for making your exact argument about Kung Pao...,1
"I'm quite a fan of xinjiang food, I love cumin and had some amazing bbq in china in this style",1
"Hahaha I do have to say if you are skilled enough you can cook rice somewhat like how you would cook quinoa -- it's kind of a point of pride for my mom to be able to ""steam"" rice to perfection on the stove.",1
Hahaha for sure! It goes against every law of stir-fry LOL!,1
Oh gosh yes recipe please!,1
"Just, random vegetables in Kung Pao. I've seen broccoli, zucchini, all kinds of nonsense. Kung Pao is scorched chili flavor with garlic and ginger over a sugar/zhenjiang vinegar sauce. Chicken, peanuts, green onions and *that's it*. I mean, I'll eat a gong bao doufu or maybe shrimp, but that's where I draw the line. You don't have to go very far out of Sichuan before people start getting creative. Kung Pao is not the place for you to dump your spare vegetables!",1
"I don't like to judge people but cooking rice by boiling on the stove is a sin.

You can get a rice pot for like $15.",1
"It drives me nuts whenever a recipe refers to a sauce in Chinese cuisine as ""gravy"".",1
Looks great. Sichuan food is so aesthetic with the red slick of oil and all the chili peppers,1
Sichuan is probably my favorite authentic Chinese food style. Although I do have a soft spot for American Chinese takeout as well.,1
I love spicy food so definitely Sichuan food too!,1

Yummy!!!!,1
One of my favorites :)! But im big on cilantro!,1
"No problem, hope you have a good quality one :) happy cooking!",1
Halibut.,1
"Hmm, this recipe points out to shake almost all of the marinade off the fish before putting it in, maybe you got too much of the marinade in the pot?",1
"I tried to make but after putting the marinated fish in the simmering gravy, the gravy turned cloudy. After that it never recovered the bright red color.",1
Looks legit - I had this at a street stall in Shanghai and they had a separate tiny copper wok for frying the spices!,1
"I'm sure there was other stuff added! But for sure if it was in a packet, most of it was salt, sugar and MSG which is available by many many names.

If it had a numbing effect, there is only one candidate I know of and that is Sichuan peppercorn (Chinese prickly ash).",1
"I have to try with pork I've never tried it before, I'm a big pork belly fan can it be done with it?",1
"Here I'm so basically there are two approcces: 
1) you make a concentrated base than dilute with simple stock or water;
2) you make the stock already diluted, that's my approach. 

For reference I made a simple stock and added beef chuck, when was tender I picked up drained and put in the fridge for easier slicing. 

This is for 1 bowl, so feel free to multiply if you want more. 

Ingredients for the soup: 300g of stock, 100g of beef, 1tbs each of neutral oil, chili oil, doubanjiang, light soy sauce and wine, 1 clove of garlic and a piece of ginger (I use it whole than remove it both garlic and ginger), some form of onion (I used the white part of a green onion), sugar, salt and dark soy sauce are up to you, plus the aromatic mix: 3 cloves, 1 star anise, 1 cardamom pod, 1 cinnamon stick and 1 tsp of Sichuan pepper corn (I suggest you to put the spices into a tea bag or something and toast them before putting them in.  You can easily pick them out and have maximum flavor. I picked them up one by one when eating but I toasted them with the oil and onions). 

Noodles: I used 125g of fresh pappardelle, but feel free to use asian noodles, I use fresh egg pasta cause here in Italy is really really cheap. 

Toppings: green part of a green onion, sesame seeds and sesame oil. 

So put oil, chili oil, onion, garlic and ginger in a pot and fry for a while, then add the beef and doubanjiang (be quick this stuff burns easily). Deglaze the pot with wine and soy sauce, add the stock and aromatic mix. Now is up to you add salt and sugar until you like the taste and adjust the color with dark soy sauce. Boil it down not too long actually cause you have a solid base in the stock.",1

"No. No. No. Second Cut Pork is NOT pork belly. It's the very top of the pork butt. No idea how to source it. You can try to buy a whole cut pork butt and use that portion, but it's obviously not economical. A whole pig doesn't actually produce much of it, so Second Cut Pork is supposed to be one of the more expensive cuts for that reason.

A lot of people think it's pork belly, because well...outside of China, or even in China, a lot of restaurants will simply substitute it for pork belly, which is wu hua rou (or five flower pork). It's a lot cheaper and a lot easier to cook. I wouldn't be surprised if there's not a single Chinese restaurant outside of China that actually uses the second cut pork for twice cooked pork like the traditional recipe calls for.

It's not a huge difference in the end. It's just the same as pretty much every single pasta carbonara in the US will be made with pancetta or bacon, but in Italy it's made from guanciale which is a completely different part of the pig (and again, far more expense). Good luck.",1

# Air Fryer Salt and Pepper Pork Chops Chinese Style (椒鹽豬扒) 

How to make chinese cantonese style salt and pepper pork chops using an air fryer. Restaurant taste and easy to make!

Visual walkthrough step-by-step [https://youtu.be/RkzSfU8gRRY](https://youtu.be/RkzSfU8gRRY)

Please consider subscribing if you end up liking the recipe, very appreciated.

## Ingredients

* 3 pork chops or pork loin cut about 1.5 cm thick
* 1 jalapeno pepper chopped and de-seeded
* 1 red bell pepper chopped and de-seeded
* 1 Shallot minced
* Sliced garlic
* Cornstarch or potato starch
* Minced green onion
* Marinade
   * 2 Tablespoon light or regular soy sauce
   * ¼ teaspoon or couple dashes white pepper
   * 1 teaspoon shaoxing rice wine
   * 1 teaspoon or a 2 finger pinch of kosher salt
   * 1 teaspoon baking powder
   * ½ teaspoon ginger powder
* Seasoning
   * 1 teaspoon salt
   * ¼ teaspoon sugar
   * ¼ teaspoon white pepper
   * MSG (optional)

## Instructions

1. Slice a very shallow grid pattern on both sides of the pork about 2mm deep.
2. Use a meat mallet or pot or pan or something to tenderize the meat. Hit down and out to flatten and spread out the meat evenly.
3. Combine marinade ingredients and mix evenly with the pork. Marinade in the fridge for at least 30 min.
4. Coat pork with a light layer of cornstarch or potato starch
5. Place in air fryer and airfryer total 13-15 minutes at 400F or 205C, non pre-heated. Check at half way point to spray oil on dry starch spots. When pork is golden brown and slightly crispy take it out and let it rest at least 5 min or so before cutting into smaller pieces.
6. Get a wok or very large pan over medium high heat, add about a tablespoon of oil, wait until oil is hot (starts to shimmer or smoke a little bit) and add in shallot and sliced garlic and stir fry until garlic starts to brown. Then add, jalapenos and bell pepper and stir fry about 30 seconds until a little softened. Then add in the pork, seasoning mix and toss to combine.",1
"Oh dang so it's exactly like peking duck but chicken, really interesting!",1
Yes and vinegar and maltose syrup was brushed on during the air drying stage. My dad made it so he knows all the details but yeah. lol,1

"Where the head at? Oh yeah, up top.",1
Thanks! Will definitely try it,1
"Yeah, to be fair I've only ever actually eaten fresh durian in hot countries (well, I guess that's where they grow). The smell kind of grows on you after a while.",1
"Oo sort of like peking duck, cool! Looks great. Did you blanch it before hanging?",1
Hung and air dried the chicken for a day overnight.,1
Looks great! How did you get that skin so crispy?,1
Omg these look so good,1

"""Super pungent"" is probably exaggerating it. I've smelled them fresh and they're really not that bad, they just smell more than we're used to when it comes to fruit imo. Maybe it depends on where you are, how warm it is and how long they've been out in the heat.",1

"Even though you have said other cooked foods are fine, I would suggest you could have some sort of health problem that could be changing your taste sensation.

Maybe check with your doctor if this continues.",1
I would search up YangZhou fried rice.  That’s the authentic fried rice from China and it utilizes many umami components in addition to like shrimp and pork to give it depth of flavor.,1

"Very odd. I’m just guessing here, but if it’s not your doubanjiang, could it be your corn starch.",1
"Fried rice is a simple dish when it comes to seasonings, so it may in fact just be soy sauce + ""wok hei"".

You usually don't just pour the soy sauce on top of the rice and let it soak in, but you actually add it to the hot pan so that it sizzles and the stir the rice around quickly, which makes the flavour a bit different.",1
"There's definitely soy sauce in Chinese restaurant fried rice.  What you're probably tasting is called ""wok hei.""  The burners that Chinese restaurants use are much more powerful than the burners on a standard home stove.  That intense heat creates flavors that are difficult to reproduce at home, people go to lengths like using a blowtorch or the burner from a turkey fryer to do their stir fries.  Here is more info on wok hei than you probably want to know:

"Here is the recipe for Typhoon Shelter Crab 避風塘炒蟹 . This a dish traditionally made by the fishermen in Hong Kong. During typhoons, they would dock their boats in areas called ""typhoon shelters"" and make this dish while waiting for the typhoon to pass.

**Ingredients:**

1 crab, (traditionally mud crabs are used. But I use dungeness crab because it's local here)

2 Cups of fried garlic (see notes below)

2 Tbsp minced garlic

3C vegetable or canola oil

2 Tbsp salted black beans, rinsed and minced

8 pieces of dried chili pepper, cut in half and seeds removed

1/2 tsp chili flakes (or more for extra spiceness)

2 scallions stalks, cut into 3rds

soy sauce for seasoning

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. If crab is alive, put the crab in the freezer for 15 minutes to ""numb"" him (it's more humane and so they won't move around or try to kill you). Remove the mantle from the belly and discard. Flip the crab over and using your thumb, carefully pry the top shell off in one piece. Quarter the crab, cutting in half crosswise and then again lengthwise. Then cut between each claw and leg so that each piece only has one leg or claw. Chop off the pointed tips of each leg and discard. Using a mallet or the side of a cleaver, gently crack the shells leaving the pieces intact. Clean the crab and lid, making sure to remove and discard the gills and mandibles. Set aside.
2. Heat a wok until hot over high heat. Add the vegetable oil and when hot, carefully add the crab pieces except for the top shell. Fry them until the meat is cooked, about 3-5 minutes. Halfway through cooking, add the top shell. Strain the crab pieces and set aside. Discard the oil except for 3 Tbsp.
3. In the same wok, sauté the black beans, minced garlic, scallions and dried chili peppers until fragrant. Add the crab pieces and fried garlic and toss. Season with a drizzle of soy sauce and chili flakes. Give the fried garlic bits a taste and adjust the soy sauce and chili flakes to your liking. Transfer everything to a large serving plate. The fried garlic bits goes well with rice.

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes for Fried Garlic:**

You can buy fried garlic at an Asian supermarket or you can use fresh garlic and fry it yourself. Using fresh garlic will taste better than store bought fried garlic.

Use a food processor to chop about 8 whole garlic bulbs. Heat 3 Cup of vegetable or canola oil over medium-low heat. Deep-fry the chopped garlic until they just begin to brown. The garlic will continue browning even after you fry them. Strain and set aside. You can reserve the oil for the crab recipe above as the oil will be flavored with garlic.",1
Wow !,1
"Im talking about the flakes and powders, not peppercorn",1
Thanks!,1
"Depends on what sichuan flake and korean flake you are talking about.  However, comparing something like heaven facing chili (Chao Tian Jiao) to gochugaru, of course the sichuan one will be hotter.",1

Wontons - boiled until cooked

Cucumbers:
Toss diced cucumber with spicy chili crisp mix or make your own. Here’s my version:

Drizzle of sesame oil, and a pinch to 1/2 tsp of salt, pepper, garlic powder, Sichuan peppercorn powder, and chili powder.  Top with crispy fried chili’s or green onion.",1
"If you're talking about Sichuan peppercorns, it's a unique spice/flavor. My opinion is they have a slight citrus flavor and a slightly metallic taste. They are special because of the numbing feeling they cause on your tongue. Very different compared to the spicy I'm used to (I'm not unfamiliar with the likes of ghost pepper)",1
You got it!,1
Thanks for including a recipe!,1
"I’ve not been able to go home, by home I mean China as a whole, for more than a year now — living abroad definitely made me more appreciative of Chinese food and so much better at cooking.

"Just maybe if you open a restaurant I could be your favorite customer... 

But seriously, I love Chongqing and Sichuan foods and I haven't found the kinds of food I am looking for since I moved back a few years ago so I have to make it myself. I really appreciate your videos",1

You have to mix it with porridge. The ultimate match,1

"Thanks!

and I actually got a deep fryer a little while ago, that has a built in filter. So once you're done, you let the oil cool down, flip the dial to drain, and the oil will get filtered into a removeable container underneath. The oil ends up clean, so you get a lot more use out of it.

I still have an airfryer that I use for most things (and I reckon you could do this in the airfryer pretty easily) but I like having the option to deep fry.",1

I'm sorry guys. I've made it few months ago. I don't remember this recipe. The glaze was made of corn starch and Korean spice paste Gochujang. Lao Gan Ma on the rice. No skin on the belly.,1
My pleasure,1
"That was half in jest.  But I didn't know what a ""shabbu"" was.  I see that it is just thinly slice meat of many kinds.  That's not hard.  Anything I can keep in my freezer I might have around.  And I've never heard of ""duck blood"" as an ingredient.  As it's not on Amazon, I'll have to look around.  Is it common at an Asian market?  There is a large one not too far from me.",1

"I see here a lot of similarities between what you do, and my [goto Hainanese Chicken Rice Recipe](https://fatmiewchef.blogspot.com/2020/04/hainanese-chicken-rice-whole-chicken.html#ingredients)

But a few major, and crucial things. 

Firstly, would you kindly use traditional Chinese when representing Cantonese? 有頭有尾 - is also a phrase used in Mandarin, but if you are going to say that it's a Cantonese phrase, traditional is strongly preferred by the few Cantonese speakers in Hong Kong who are fighting to keep their language alive. That is to say, there are also Cantonese speakers in China as well, but I think their struggle isn't as dire as those in HK right now. 

I notice that in the recipe I linked, they brine the chicken first. I've tried it without brining the chicken, and it makes a huge difference in the flavor, and the texture. 

There's also a stage where they oil the cooked chicken after the ice bath in some sesame oil. I made this dish once when I ran out of sesame oil (I know I know), and it didn't taste as awesome. 

Then of course, there's the presentation. When dining out, the Hainanese Chicken is always deboned, but Bak Chit Gai isn't. 

Any idea why this is the case? 

Also the scallion oil is made differently. Yours fries the ginger and scallions in oil first, and add sesame oil. I think that's probably the superior method. Sesame oil is delicious.",1
"I followed this recipe https://youtu.be/C7woB7FCekQ

I made it a little less spicy, because my roommate can't handle too much spice

I love this recipe, so tasty 😋",1
Where's the recipe?,1
Halal chicken may work. It's worth a shot. The chicken should look skinnier and skin a little thicker.,1
"They actually talk about it in the video. They say any chicken is fine as long as it's small (less than 4 lbs). They also talk about the difference between two types of Chinese whole chicken. Their videos are really well done and a joy to watch. Highly recommend watching!

Edit: just noticed they talk about it in the write up above. Oops!",1
"Heads up they look different! They will look more lean and the ones at my Asian grocer will have the head and neck still attached. A lot of the time the legs won’t be folded in.

The chicken makes a HUGE DIFFERENCE. Worth the search.",1
I will try from my middle eastern butcher,1
Don't get any of the grocery store roasting chickens. You need young chickens from a farm or asian grocery store that doesn't force feed them hormones and whatnot. The skin of the roasting chickens just turn to mush after you boil them.,1
"If you can take some heat then do the Chongqing style hotpot, nothing overpowers the mighty mala!",1
Haha. I LOVE SPAM. But I just don’t want everything else to taste like it.,1
"Not really but if you have decided you don’t like spam, you don’t have to invite it to the hotpot party.",1
"I have a question about the chicken, what kind of chicken you use ? Like in USA what kind of chicken should I buy for this.. how to clean it and get rid of excess fat",1
Aw thanks,1
Does everything that gets cooked after the spam taste like spam?,1
"You don’t? I eat Chinese food most nights so this was literally all in my fridge/freezer as shabbu meat goes great in noodles soups also. When I work late I don’t stop by the grocery store.

PS duck blood is vacuum sealed in liquid and stored at room temp so it’s literally one of the easiest things to keep around.",1
"What kind of meat was it?

Looks like braised sweet potato and pork belly.
I don't know what it's be called exactly but some variation of this

红烧地瓜肉

Could be wrong though",1
"They also started selling literal frozen food. Like the frozen containers you buy at the grocery store and heat up. They just heat it up for you. I know a lot of their stuff is frozen already but this is another level.

Oh and they sell beer.",1
Looks great! Wish I had a plate,1
I’ve never heard of spam and hotpot till now. It’s def worth a try next time I do hotpot. Thanks for diversifying my hotpot knowledge!,1
"Actual Chongqing born hotpot addict here. I even went to Chinatown market to get the ‘Meilin” brand of spam for this spread. I would testify it’s almost the best way to eat spam. It is common in most places in China: I’ve lived in Beijing for 10 years, Guangzhou for 1 and Shanghai for 2.",1

But yeah lol, those are my picks.

There’s this one place that does a satay tomato soup with a giant block of roast pork and tons of shellfish. That ones wild",1
I’m curious what other “non common” meats you all use.,1
You know on Facebook there was a “SPAM Challenge” going on where people would show how many slices they could get from a can of SPAM. One guy cheated and used a deli slicer. If I recall correctly someone had like 30 slices.,1

- chili flakes 
- white peppercorn powder
- salt
- Chinese 5 spices
- fermented black beans
- MSG (optional)

I mix the ingredients above in a heat proof bowl or pot. Then I heat some oil (enough to at least cover the mixture) to 400F, and then pour the hot oil into the chili mixture. Stir the mixture with a metal fork/spoon or chopsticks until everything is well combined.",1

Kaya and milk separately. But now I wonder how would it be mixed..,1

Ooh I’ll have to try that combo. I added a bit of oyster sauce after I snapped the pic but I think the beauty of this combo is that even just a dash of salt is great since the egg itself is so creamy and flavorful,1
Never had it like that before. Do you a season your egg? I love it with kaya and sweetened condensed milk.,1

"I can't tell you the exact ingredient amounts for some of the seasoning I used. But I basically used

\-- 4 boneless chicken thighs and minced them myself using a cleaver. I like the texture of hand minced meat more than machine ground meat. I prefer chicken thighs over breast meat because the latter makes the filling taste dry

\-- 6 dried shiitake mushrooms washed, rehydrated, and finely diced

\-- 1 bunch of cilantro washed and finely chopped

\-- 1 bunch of green onion washed and finely chopped

\-- 4 cloves of garlic, minced

\-- 2 inch knob of ginger, peeled and grated

\-- 1 tsp 5 spices

\-- 1 tsp white peppercorn powder (black peppercorn powder is fine as well)

\-- 1 tbsp oyster sauce

\-- 1 tbsp shaoxing wine

\-- 2 tbsp water

\-- 1 tbsp sesame oil

\-- soy sauce to taste

\-- salt to taste

To gauge if you need more salt, simply steam a bit of the filling in a pot (or microwave it, but make sure to cover the bowl if you microwave to prevent potential splatter).",1

I hear you! My newest mission is making hot pot that is a small and regular thing.  Maybe you guys just try boiling it down to a few things that you guys like and picking one type of soup!  It sounds like hot pot is what you need to get you through your Michigan winter!,1
"Dude(or dudette? LOL)! It takes practice, but once you've done it a few times, it gets much easier. Homemade wraps are in my opinion really rewarding and better than store bought ones! If your problem is shaping the wraps, one cheat is to use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a thin sheet, and use a round cookie cutter to cut the wraps (or a metal cocktail shaker lol). Some people use a pasta roller to first roll out a sheet of dough and then use a cookie cutter to make the wraps.",1
Dough is something I can't do at all.. kneading rolling not my thing your dumplings look professional dude !,1
"I made the dough. Using baker's percentage: 80% korean wheat flour (basically white flour that doesn't have any of the enrichment/additives. I got it from a Korean market near where I live), 20% potato starch, and 52% hydration with boiling water.",1

"Ugh rub it in. Michigander here. It's literally freezing (or colder) here right now. I used to live in North Texas and find myself dreaming of the cloudless, sunny days in tx, especially on snowy days like today.

"Hahaha. Yeah there’s soooo many neat rice dishes around I’m sure we all call some of them a mixed-up name sometimes. Pilaf is pretty close!! I honestly love how the Chinese language uses wordplay. So many fun phrases and titles. Shabby rice, that’s cute.",1
"Try some of Fuchsia Dunlop's cookbooks. They're not exclusively vegetarian or vegan but contain many recipes that are. All the dish names are in Chinese too, with pinyin. You'll likely have a bit trouble finding some of the home cooking-style dishes (e.g. the ones in her ""Every Grain of Rice"" book) in restaurants, though.",1
"I also asked around, and another name for this dish in Shanghai is ""han suan fan"" 寒酸饭 - literally ""shabby rice"", originally made with leafy greens and some lard as a struggle meal. 

Thank you for the analysis. That's pretty much my understanding of this dish. 

One thing is for sure. It's not a pilaf.",1

Thank you!,1
"I did, and then I went to work and forgot about this all weekend!! Oh for shame haha. So basically, we so far have both been vaguely correct in our understanding, the reality fell between these two angles-it doesn’t just mean side dish but it also sort of doesn’t just mean veg with rice. I called a council of the Chinese roommates. Two have been here less than a year and one has been here eight years. They argued over it for a bit then gave me a clearer idea of the meaning.

So cai is used colloquially with fan to generally mean side dish of vegetables mixed with rice, but on its own cai doesn’t mean all vegetables, it just means leaves. Leaf vegetables. Bok choy, pea sprouts, dandelion sprouts, spinach, lettuce. That sort of thing. It’s somewhat analogous to how English speakers call a variety of things salad i.e. chicken salad, shrimp salad even though when we just say the word ‘salad’ we think of mixed veg over leaves. Cai fan is often made with extras such as a small percentage of meat, so it has come to mean rice mixed dish, because it’s often got a lot of ingredients including non leaf vegetables. Apparently cai is the ending syllable in the names of all leaf vegetables on signs in the grocery store? They showed me some photos of produce sections to explain when I asked for deeper info than how they just told me before cai in this phrase would imply dish rather than vegetables. 

Thank you for your patience!! :)",1
"I made the recipe as written, except that I threw a handful of dried Thai chiles into the oil just before adding the ground beef.  It's a pretty amazing dish.

Really appreciate 😍 thx !!,1
"What you are looking at here is as follows:  boneless beef short rib (frozen and sliced thinly), thin sliced pork chop which I dry-brine with salt, butterflied gulf shrimp, soft (NOT silken) tofu, dumplings (pictured are shrimp and pork wontons, I like the size of them for hot pot),  mushrooms ( pictured are beech I also like wood ear), any sort of green veggie you like I like hearty veggies, noodles of choice ( I used rice vermicelli that I cooked, washed, and portioned out because I hate it when they become a tangled sticky mess), not pictured is lotus root but any starchy root will do.  My broth isn’t typical I think.  Basically I went to the store to see what was cheap and got a few pounds of chicken necks and feet which I then pressure cooked for an hour with half an onion, knob of sliced ginger, and a smashed head of garlic. After cooking I strained and then seasoned to taste with salt, msg, sugar, and a tiiiiiny bit of vinegar.  I split this soup and to one half I added my store bought hot pot base to taste, maybe half a cup worth.  I add less than the package says too because it’s expensive and I want to make it last.  

Equipment: pot, I got a cheap divided pot from my local Asian market, heat source: gas is best but I’m using an electric",1
"Hot pot is pretty free form, I’ve got a Chinese friend whose husband always requests hot dogs when they do hot pot!  But I will gladly share with you my method.  Also Chinese Cooking Demystified and Souped up recipes on YouTube plus my Chinese friends are great resources!  Give me some time and I will also send you a link to the base that I use, i need to look it up.",1

Yay! Hope you’ll like it!!,1
"good question LOL. my mother-in-law made this, I should have watched.... :(",1
"It'll be a bit long, so.

1) Ingredients: 250g of pork belly, green part of leeks, 4/5 slices of ginger, 1tbs of Sichuan peppercorn, 1 star anise, 1 stick of cinnamon and half a glass of wine (75g more or less).
Put everything together in a large pot with enough water to cover it and bring it to boil until you remove all the scum that floats. After that wash thoroughly and put in the fridge (it'll be way easier to slice). When it's cold slice thin and set aside. 

2) Ingredients: sliced pork belly, 1 leek, 1 clove of garlic (I use it whole than discard but you can chop it however you like and add moke if you want), 1 thumb size piece of ginger (the same as the garlic), 1tbs of doubanjiang, 1tsp of tianmianjiang, 1tbs each of sugar, soy sauce, wine and adjust salt and pepper q.b. 

3) Stir fry pork belly, no need for oil. Render out the fat from pork, add leek, garlic, ginger and the other ingredients. Stir fry until almost dry (I like it more saucy so it's up to you).",1

"Props for being resourceful haha. As long as the soup was good! Once, when I was hankering for some comfort food, I looked up a nearby place that sold wonton noodles. Took it home only to see that they gave me ramen instead of egg noodles. I thought to myself, ""Well that's disappointing, but at least I'm a sucker for those cups of instant noodles."" But then the soup tasted like watered-down chicken stock and that's when I was disgusted. It was an authentic Cantonese restaurant too, so I don't know what their excuse was ┐( ˘_˘)┌",1
Shh...yes haha. Ran out of fresh egg noodles and didn’t want to head to the asian market for some. Used instant ramen mixed with some dried chinese egg noodles.,1
Is that... ramen?,1
"We like it spicy so we make chicken stock then add chili oil (homemade with Sichuan pepper in it), spicy red bean paste, dried chilis, garlic, ginger, dried mushrooms, bay leaf, clove, green onion, goji berry and soy sauce. 

We also add fish sauce and sesame oil which is not traditional but we like the taste. If you fry the aromatics in chicken of beef fat first it adds a nice flavour.",1

"I followed the following steps, but I eyeballed the amount of the ingredients.
1) cut the pork into strips and marinate it with salt, cooking wine, and white pepper.
2) roll each strip into like a ball and coat with tapioca (corn starch should do too; the rolling part takes time and it can be skipped)
3) fry the meat in oil in a saucepan until it's golden (make sure it is cooked). Take it out and let it cool. Refry the meat for less than a minute before taking it out again.
4) use a different pan, heat a little oil. Stir in ketchup, a bit sugar, white vinger, and a bit salt (you can taste the sauce and adjust accordingly). Keep the sauce in low heat. When the sauce is bubbly, mix the fried meat with the sauce until the sauce covers the meat. 
5) sprinkle some green onion

Hope this helps! I am not experienced in making this dish. It is very manageable:)",1

"On this week's episode, I took the time to learn about my family's history! It all started when my great great grandfather immigrated from China to Hawaii to work on a plantation. The origins of this week's dumpling can be traced all the way back to 1896.

***If you are interested in the recipe:***

**Filling consists of:**

* Pork
* Shrimp
* Carrots
* Green Onion
* Bamboo Shoots
* Shiitake Mushrooms
* Cabbage
* Corn Starch
* Salt and Pepper
* An Egg

I eye ball the entire ingredient list just like my Grandma. There's no specific ingredient amount. Mix all ingredients in one direction, so that it becomes sticky, and fibrous.

**Crystal Skin Wrapper:**

* 2 cups wheat starch
* 1 1/3 cups tapioca starch
* 1tsp salt
* 4 tsp oil
* 2 cups 4tbs boiling water

Mix all dry ingredients and oil together. Add boiling water to the flour mixture and mix immediately. Knead dough until a smooth. If hot allow to rest for a few minutes, you'll want to knead the dough when its warm.

portion dough mass into logs and cut each log into a disk. Then create a dumpling wrapper using a rolling pin, tortilla press, or anything you have.

Fold dumpling in whatever way you may like\~

**Steam Dumpling:**

10-12 minutes in a steamer.

I really enjoyed this dumpling. It honestly brings me back to my childhood when we would get this type of dumpling at family gatherings; my grandma would make these all the time for us grandchildren. My mom still makes this 2-3 times a year! But really, my Grandma's always tastes better.

It was nice going down memory lane, and relearning our family history. I truly believe that flavor in food comes from the memories sparked from certain foods. If you would like to check out the channel, I post weekly dumpling videos here:

In the US though but availability should be similar.",1
"Hey!

I'm in Canada. I bought out all their stock (2). It looks like you can still add it in your cart but my order is still processing.

Thanks for pointing this one out. Because they only have 2, and the other is sold out, i'm worried this is the last of it :(",1
Where are you located? I'll assume the US. [This](https://www.smegamart.ca/product-details.jsp?i=1287) site ships to the US. It's a form of 辣椒酱 (la jiao jiang) supposedly. It might help to look that up. I'm not familiar with your specific sauce. Sambal oelek also shows up but that's common enough that I imagine you've had it.,1
"I apologize if this is a dumb question, but what’s the point of frying something, making it crispy, just to steam it after and lose the crispness ?   They could’ve stir fried the fried pork to add flavor or sauce, why steam a fried item ?",1

"A lot of the baked breads have the same dough, so you could follow a recipe for pineapple bun for the dough. The lemon curd is a corn starch based curd, as opposed to a yolk based curd.

"&gt;Pilaf has a specific flavor though, so that’s not the same thing. Just so you know I didn’t guess, I gave you a native translation. It’s like  비빔밥 in Korean-which is the Korean version of Chinese “dish rice” since bibimbap means “mixed into rice”; you wouldn’t call 비빔밥 “pilaf”-you’d just call it mixed rice bowl or bibimbap.

Couple of things, firstly, I'm pretty sure the 菜 in 菜饭 refers to ""vegetables"", in that this dish is mainly some type of vegetables cooked with rice. 

The Shanghainese version is famous, but there are also Fujian / Mingnan versions called 包菜饭/咸菜饭/芥菜饭. 

I'm trying to find the orgins of the dish but having a hard time. 

_____

Pilaf, pilav, pilau, pilaffa come in many variants, from India to Turkey to Xinjiang

What's common to all these variants, is that the rice grains are all seperate from one another, and not mushy. 

In the recipes for Chinese 菜饭, I'm not sure if this is a primary focus. 

However, the main cooking method is similar. 

Wash rice. 

Fry ingredients. 

Mix ingredients with rice.

"For the ones in purple bags, in my experience, and looking at the ingredient lists, these soups are the sort you cook and drink the broth as a sort of medicinal soup.  Sometimes you would add meat as an additional medicinal ingredient, like pork or chicken feet.  Different combinations of ingredients are meant to help with things like digestion, cholesterol, ""yeet hay"" or things of that nature.  I don't think they are meant to be a base soup that you can do things further with, like one does with a chicken stock.  Some of the ingredients could have a bitter or medicinal taste.  

The red one does seem specifically to be for hotpot since it says so on the ingredient panel.  It sounds like it is a paste or powder mix, does it feel like that?",1

"“Dish rice”. It’s a compound word, a colloquialism. It’s a saying from the Shanghai area and someone from somewhere else might not understand it. It sort of means vegetables mixed in to rice. It can also mean any other thing mixed in to rice basically but it’s usually vegetables. If you switch cai and fan, and say fan cai, it means your rice dish and also the rest of your food, “whole meal”.",1
"Thanks for the insightful reply! Yeah I'm not worried in the least about the recipes themselves, almost every review raves about how delicious everything comes out. But good point on it bei g one family's perspective.

The original chef is from Xi'an, and his son, the co-owner, partly grew up in the states.  As a result, it's one family's take on the food from the region, and not something comprehensive or deeply researched.  You can go to their website &amp; menu to get a sense of what to expect in the cookbook.  As I understand, their most popular dish (cumin lamb biang biang noodles) isn't an exact dish you'd find in Xi'an.

Also, keep in mind that they're restauranteurs first and foremost, not full-time recipe developers or food historians.  You're gonna get solid recipes about the things they know how to cook, but not necessarily the range and detail you'll get in a cookbook from someone who's focus is recipes.",1
Oh wow lol okay I am sure it will be fine to eat! :) Enjoy!,1
It's a sealed bag from the shops,1
I think if you kept the bag sealed then it should be fine - if you leave it open it will get freezer burn and will change it's texture more but it's still okay to eat,1
Steamed not streamed 😂,1
My wife had one in the freezer for at least 2-3 years before I learned she had no plans for it. It went in a winter soup and was just fine.,1
"If you're just gonna throw it in a soup or something, it's fine... It won't have quite the same fresh texture, but more than acceptable",1
Thanks for sharing Bea :),1
"Ooh! Basically a combination of eggs, garlic shoots, bell peppers, and tomatoes in a stir fry (with vinegar and soy sauce) and then water to make the soup. After the soup mixture boiled, I added pieces of dough mix (just flour and water, and then rolled out and cut into strips). Really not that bad, and I say that as a very basic and low skilled cook. Thanks for asking!",1
"I often use a mixture of mushrooms and TVP rehydrated in veggie stock. I imagine the impossible meat would work well, the TVP just adds a bit of texture when I make it that's missing with just mushrooms regardless of the type used (I saw mention of king oysters which are meaty but not quite like the faux meat).",1
"It takes time, but actually isn’t too hard!",1
That’s master level... I haven’t tackled that yet.,1
"It’s its own cuisine!

How similar is orange chicken to buffalo sauce marinades? I’ve never had American Chinese.",1
"Aw wholesome. I crave Chinese food all the time, sans bebe",1
How much of this did you make yourself and how much was pre-prepped?,1
"Ah man, I make my own dumpling wrappers, but I don’t think I’ve nailed it yet!

The dough won’t pleat like this.",1
I use a vegetable steamer (metal) with some oil brushed to the bottom to stop dumplings sticking. Works well for me :),1
What are good brands?,1
What goes in it?,1
I like minced mushroom:),1
"It's super, super pungent!",1
"This is how my husband likes them! Is from hubei province!  We go much heavier with the cooking wine though, I’d recommend it, really helps the Sichuan peppercorns pop!",1
"I don't find it smelly either, frozen or fresh. I've been trying to find the words to describe the smell and pineapple with custard is the best I can describe it",1
Does a fresh one smell that much different?,1
"Look at some recipes for mapo. There's like 30g of pork for 350g of tofu. The pork is there for flavor not because this is a meat dish. Its fried in oil early on in the dish to accomplish this. As such, I'd use shiitakes. Maybe use kombu dashi instead of water for more umami lost by not using meat.",1
Buy it fresh next time and come back to us 😉,1

9. Done!",1
Use minced up shiitake mushrooms. It tastes wonderful.,1
[deleted],1
"No idea why people say they stink. I've bought frozen durian once, and it smelled like a mix of gasoline and some fruity, pineapple-like component. Now you may not want your food to smell like gasoline, but still, it was not an unpleasant smell at all.",1
"I personally think a mixture between rehydrated dried shiitake and fresh mushrooms, some chopped and some pulsed in a food processor is much the better option. You can add a bit more oil for frying the doubanjiang etc and for me it’s much nicer than any mass processed meat substitute...",1
I'd avoid shiitake mushrooms. They have a super distinct flavor. It could turn out delicious but if youre trying to really replicate the flavor and taste of mapo tofu then id avoid them. Impossible meat would be better for texture. Maybe fry it in peanut oil,1
I use Quorn mince (UK),1
"I have also used textured vegetable protein.  It is not just the meat protein that needs replacing, it is the meat fat. I like to fry vegetarian options in a more viscous fat.  I like coconut oil because it reminds me of one of my other favorite dishes, rendang.",1
"Impossible meat would mirror the ground pork texture better. I've used soyrizo before and it worked pretty well, too. But I've also just made it with tofu and green onions.",1
"Hmmm, good question. Most of the ingredients for the hotpot base I had on hand and purchased over time. The base includes facing heaven chili,  lantern chili, and Sichuan peppercorn I purchased from [Mala Market](https://themalamarket.com/). Fermented black beans, Pixian doubanjiang, shaoxing wine, and rock sugar that I sourced from a local asian market. All of the hotpot dishes are not too expensive on their own but I guess they can add up when buying everything for one meal. The raw lamb was probably the priciest at maybe $10 for the portion.",1
Looks amazing! How much did all of the ingredients cost you?,1
"Oil, sesame oil, garlic, scallion, salt, and msg.",1
"I'd like to cook on water, with pork slice or pork balls and vegitable leafs. my favorite. :D",1
"The two dishes of white and dark balls are fish-balls and pork-balls, and there're dumplings. So it's satisfying for two persons, I think. \^\_\^",1
Ok lol. Wasn't sure if I should pan fry or cook on water!,1
"It's some type of purple sweet potato noodle(紫薯面), just cook it like other noodles with meat paste, tomato sauce, garlic， eggs or something else you'd like, and eat it :D",1
Good to see a fellow ran of spicy.  Looks great.,1
"They just happen to look a lot alike.

https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ellie-krieger/minestrone-soup-recipe-1973378",1
This is how I grew up eating pasta at home. Had first real pasta in my late teens with friends.,1
"I actually haven’t ever had minestrone. Any resemblance is unintentional, :/ It’s 面片",1
"Most likely soy sauce, green onions. Roast crushed garlic in a small pot. Pour the soy sauce, add a little sugar so it's not so salty, bring to boil. Add your green onions when it's almost room temperature. Or you can bring the soy sauce to boil with green onions. All preference.

Very popular soy sauce when it comes to eating whole chicken in thr chinese culture. You can also add dry chilli pepper. Gives a lot of flavor.",1
How did you take this photo? You position yourself on a chair? Like how there's no shadow,1
I didn’t even realize minestrone was Chinese.,1
Man that is great. At my restaurant we make our own borth with chicken and pork rib bones. Customer always say our soup is so good cause taste real. Well duh lol. These western customers too. What happens when they eat too much vietnamese msg soups or tim hortons soups lol,1
That looks beautiful,1
"Recipe pls. Also, what's in the little bowls? Sauce with green onion?",1
I love fried lotus root,1
"It was homemade. I made a stock the day before with beef bones, pork ribs, ginger, and scallions. Then made the hotpot base before it was time to eat.",1
Did you make the soup base? Or buy it?,1
Sweet potato noodles,1
what's that grey-looking thing lower left of the picture? rice noodles?,1
What are the three top dishes?,1
*My Tummy* wants to know your location.,1

"This traditional Chinese dessert is very popular all year round, especially during Chinese New Year! The dough is crispy, chewy, and packed with the sesame flavor. Inside is a large hollow. In addition to the sweet red bean filling, other popular options include brown sugar, jujube, peanut, lotus seeds, etc. You can also leave the inside empty and enjoy the jelly texture of the sesame dough!",1
You got me there!,1
what is chicken powder? you mean like bouillon?,1
omg 🥺💗,1
That looks awesome! (except that meat plate looks way too ... reasonably portioned),1
You wanna use Chicken Powder. The flavour is more mellow.,1
Recipe?,1
The egg,1
10 mins is slow tbh,1
"I absolutely love buffalo wings. The wings of a chicken used to be one of the garbage parts. Now in my city, the wings are the most expensive part of the chicken. Chicken legs are now what's inexpensive. I just wish I could find tiny legs to make ""buffalo wings"" because it is similar to a wing drummet.",1
"Same. People stopped eating steaks and started eating other parts of the animal. All the previously ""poor people"" meat are expensive now.",1
 a lot of americans (or at least the ones i ran into) get grossed out by the sight of it or never tried it. i think it's such a tender piece of meat with great flavor!,1

i will take that action!,1
Thanks so much!,1
google suan la fen,1
Thanks. In the supermarket I just kind of assumed they were all dried mushrooms/fragrant ingredients that I could mix together and turn into some sort of spicy hybrid thing with chicken/ham/noodles. Then I checked the ingredients and there’s dried fruit and stuff so I figured I’d ask on here.,1
"oxtail soups in latin cuisine and oxtail curry in caribbean cuinsine too. Some Italian pasta sauces use oxtail meat, but it doesn't have it's tell tale bones visible in there. So..maybe not slept on?",1
"While I love hotpot, I tend to want hotpot a lot more than the rest of the family. In those cases, I just make it on the stove by adding things to the base, longest cooking time to shortest. You can do that if you don't have the induction cooker. It tastes ok, but I think the broth doesn't build as much taste over the longer hotpot cooking (I usually add my noodles at the end to try to get the flavors). 

I haven't used the soup bases (my wife has but I didn't pay attention to how to use them) so I don't have much I can add about those.",1
"Totally not slept on, if price increases over the last 15 years have been any indication of growing demand &gt;&lt; but yea oxtail is amazing",1
Lol that’s true. And Hell yeah it’s udon!,1
Is this a Asian version of surf and turd. And is that udon!?,1
What is the sphere thing?,1
"It’s in Chinatown in Houston, old school Taiwanese joint called “China Gourmet.”",1
same here! :(,1
"Where I live, oxtail is pricey. 😢",1
sure was!,1
Yummy.,1
Yummy,1
Yummy.,1
"I like the idea of using the soup bases for ham or chicken. I don’t have a hotpot setup, can I use the red packaging for anything else? Or can I combine them to make some spicy chicken/ham soup hybrid?",1
This looks like Bento Xpert in Milwaukee WI. But i am sure it’s from somewhere else!,1
Add a bit of garlic and ginger for a nice flavor boost.,1
"wheres this from?  


needa go there!",1
I'm sure you are aware that pasta came from China. The Italians just improved it,1
I'm Italian and my gf is originally from HK. It's sad that I will have to call the police on her next time we go to Italy.,1

I’m Chinese and live in Hawaii. This does not look appetizing.,1
ahhhh i miss this so much,1
Thank you!,1
Great tips and I love this soup!,1
Need ideas for chunky soups. Made mental note of this.,1
It’s like comfort food haha asian version of chicken noodle soup,1
I'm calling the Italian Pasta Police,1
One of my favorite things to eat :). My family will also throw corn into the mix as well,1
I always thought that was just random vegetable soup in western HK style restaurants. This explains a lot,1
i don't like how they cut up the egg for you though. is the soup just chicken broth or stock?,1
Nice,1
Can't wait for recipe,1
"cool ill check it out  


ive made it a couple of times recently but im always down to see how others make it and if i can do something better :)",1
Haha most nights it’s not like this for us either — the cold pizza and beer combo also works!,1
It so is! It’s one of my favorite pork belly dishes!,1

"Flavorful Origins on Netflix is great, I've learnt about a load of foods I'd never heard of before. Rushan is in the first episode of the second season too, Yunnan Cuisine - Dairy Products",1
Got a recipe for that? Looks great!,1
Looks good,1
"Incredible recipe! My mouth was watering the whole video, especially at the end when the meat just fell right off ☺️",1
"It's pork belly cut into strips, essentially you are making Bacon.   
We didn't use a traditional recipe. The marinade can be whatever you like (eg: soy sauce, oyster sauce, salt, MSG, chilli powder, chilli flakes), we tried kecap manis, but it turned out too sweet. I won't give the recipe we used because we are still experimenting and don't want to give bad advice. Salt is important for preserving.  
Some ovens won't go low enough with the temperature so people might prop the door open or buy a dehydrator.  
We dried it in the oven for 24 hours, and then smoked it with rice in a wok afterwards.  
When finished the pork strips can be individually wrapped in cling wrap and stored in the fridge for a few weeks.",1
These look amazing! The fried rushan reminds me a lot of deep fried bean curd skin.,1
Could you do this with pig tails too?,1
"In larger cities, you can find shops with boiled or steamed dumplings on the menu!",1
Oh it’s not - but these last me til warmer weather when I’m usually sick of dumplings for a while lol 😂,1
Wow!! 6 pounds!! Y’all are pros!,1
"CHINESE OXTAIL STEW! 

  
Oxtails are stick-to-your-stomach rich and indulgent, and to me, there's no better way to eat them than in a luxurious, melt-in-your-mouth stew! I grew up eating my grandma's Chinese version, and it's truly one of the easiest yet richest meals you could enjoy: it's fragrant from spices like star anise, cloves, and ginger, and has meat that's fall-off-the-bone tender, and what may be the best thing about this version is that it's quick and easy to make in an Instant Pot! While this stew could take 3-5 hours with constant nursing on the stove, the Instant Pot allows you to pressure cook this comforting Chinese stew in just 45 min!

**Chinese Oxtail Stew recipe**  
*Ingredients:* 

* 1 Tbsp neutral oil 
* 3.5-4 lb oxtails, trimmed and de-fatted
* 6 whole cloves 
* 4 whole star anise
* 3 bay leaves
* 1 inch piece ginger, sliced and smashed 
* 7-8 garlic cloves, smashed 
* 2 tsp sugar (or rock sugar) 
* 2 Tbsp dark soy sauce 
* 3 Tbsp light soy sauce 
* 1/2 C shaoxing wine (or dry sherry) 
* 1.5 C water 

*Directions:* 

1. Turn Instant Pot on ""saute"" mode and add 1 Tbsp oil to the pot. Allow to heat up. Then, add oxtails in groups so that you brown \*all\* sides of the oxtails. More browning = more flavor! 
2. Once all oxtails are browned on all sides, turn ""saute"" mode off and pour out any excess oil from the pot. Turn ""saute"" mode on again, and add the cloves, star anise, bay leaves, ginger, and garlic cloves. Saute until the spices are fragrant and the garlic/ginger have browned a bit. 
3. Add in remaining ingredients (sugar, soy sauces, wine, and water) to the pot. Stir to combine. Then, add in all the browned oxtails. Turn saute mode off. 
4. Put lid on Instant Pot, switch to High Pressure mode,  and set timer for 45 min to pressure cook. Make sure the knob is set to ""sealing."" 
5. Once 45 min is up, allow pot to naturally release, then open the pot. Switch the mode to ""saute"" and allow the oxtail sauce to reduce until it can coat the back of a spoon. 
6. Season to taste with salt/pepper. Garnish with chopped scallions and cilantro, serve with steaming hot rice, and enjoy.",1
"I don’t, but they do take a full bin in my two bin freezer! Tossed out some old stuff to make room.",1
"I buy the stuff in the freezers/refrigerator section of Great Wall or H Mart- the cheapest ones, nothing fancy.  I prefer the white dough ones. Round for dumplings, square for soup wontons.",1
"No don’t cook it. Put no more than a teaspoon in wontons because they are boiled from frozen and take a while to cook. 
No more than a tablespoon in dumplings - and I generally make pot stickers instead of boiling dumplings so they cook a good 15-20 minutes.",1
"According to Flavorful Origins, the Chinese have their own prosciutto-like cured ham too.",1
"I have a 25cm and a 30 cm one. The 30 cm one is BIG, I use my 25cm 90% of the time. 

They're easy to clean &amp; use, would highly recommend picking one up. 

A lot of steamers are pretty shoddily made, so if you're going to have to pay extra to have it shipped to where you are I'd recommend buying a brand you recognize.",1
[removed],1
"Requesting more recipes from Chinese minority groups, please!!",1
"I personally prefer my metal steamer. If you don’t get the bamboo steamer super dry it ruins it. 

Besides that, for a bamboo steamer you want it slightly bigger than the diameter of the pot you’ll use to boil the water. Then you can usually stack as many as you want together.",1
For 6/7 pounds of pork and veggies usually yield about 350 dumplings. I’ve never counted but we use up all our baking sheets and other pans for freezing the dumplings. We fill up (8) one gallon ziploc bags.,1
Do you have a recipe and can add more details about the oven?  I’m interested in doing something similar but not sure where to start.,1
Not currently but it depends on what type of custom stickers. Feel free to DM me. Sorry I don’t know about androids,1
"Goddamn, yes! 

What I'd give to be able to make handpulled noodles at home. Please tell us your techniques.",1
Is there also another program similar to procreate for android?,1
Are you taking any customers for custom stickers?,1
Congratulations! Wishing you a happy and yummy journey! 🥡🍼,1
More dog please,1
Recipe!??!!,1
"We are more on the every other month schedule, 3-5 lb of pork and equal volume of veggies. I can't imagine 2 lb of pork being enough for a whole year of dumplings!",1
I use procreate on my iPad and print with the HP envy 6055 printer and cut using the Cricut explore air 2 :) I use sheet labels glossy sticker paper,1
"Awesome, I appreciate your tips!",1
"[This](https://thewoksoflife.com/pork-chive-dumplings/) recipe is a good “starter” recipe.  Omit the dough recipe and get pre-made dumplings skins (round ones are for dumplings and square ones are for wontons). You can add/delete ingredients to your liking. For example, add shrimp, chicken, chestnuts, shiitake mushrooms, Napa cabbage. We add whatever we have on hand.",1
"Omg. What program or machine you use to print these? 

And care to let me know where to get the blank sheets?",1
Should be selling these. Wish western Chinese food will go for these over the labour intensive deep fried food.,1
"Not OP, but I make literally hundreds of dumplings like this a year. I haven't found this experience with twin marquis myself (so I'd suggest try to cook the dumplings differently, like boiling).

Though to your question, I've found that the Yisin brand, while cheaper at my super market, cooks just as well (and doesn't crack after being frozen or anything else I might be afraid of in cheaper wrappers).",1
No problem! I absolutely love the xiaolongbao and the bakery stickers :~),1
Everyone copying the dog in the background gimmick,1
"yes, the amount of filling is usually about 20-30g per wonton/dumpling so it gets cooked pretty quickly either by steaming, boiling or pan-frying if making potstickers.",1
"It's funny - there's folklore in some parts of China where apparently the sort of cravings hints at the gender of the baby. Specifically, if you crave sour foods, it's likely a boy; if you crave spicy foods, it's likely a girl. 

Not sure how that narrows things down for you - but enjoy the food nonetheless!",1
"What brand of dumpling wrappers do you recommend? I recently tried twin marquis and no matter how long I cooked them, they weren’t cooked through where the pleats were. :(",1
Recipe please? 🙏,1
"This is a fantastic idea. 

Just to be clear: you don’t cook the meat mixture at all before wrapping?",1
"I’m pregnant 20w and right now and spicy sour dishes are my favorite. Sauerkraut fish, rice noodles with chili oil and vinegar, spicy pickled veggies (hunan style). Chinese food is something I’ve LOVED eating over the pregnancy because most authentic Chinese food is packed with nutrients. 

Best of luck on your journey! Delicious Vivian and Chef Wang are two you tubers (that have videos with eng subs) I follow with great recipes (chef wang’s food you will need to know your way around a kitchen but it sounds like you have a good skill base to dive into authentic Chinese)

Hope those recommendations can get you started!",1
Yay! I hope you like them &lt;3,1
Thank you! :)),1

"It’s a quarterly ritual in my household (dumplings and wontons). Usually about 6 pounds of ground pork, a large bok choy, jiou chai (chives), one bunch green onions, ginger, water chestnuts, 6/7 packs of skins, a mess of sauces, spices, and whatever else we can find. Fun times.",1
whaat jealous D:,1
literally eating a hot dog bun while seeing this.,1
remember the dog tax please,1
Looks so fresh and delicious! Did you leave the cumin whole? The pupper looks like he's waiting to be served. 😋,1
Posted!,1
"I don’t use a specific recipe because I’ve been doing this so long. I change my recipe up a bit most years. 

Take a big chunk of ground pork, this year 2 lbs, and mix with some combination of green onion, chives, diced tender greens (spinach, Chinese broccoli, cabbage). The more greens, the lighter and softer the mouth feel. The more meaty, the chewier and harder the mouthfeel. 

Mushrooms, dried shrimp, other ground meats, onions and cilantro all good options.

Add no more than a half head of minced garlic cloves, a 2-4” finger of diced ginger.

Then splash in around 1-3 tbsp of flavorings:
Light soy       
Dark soy       
Sesame oil           
Chinese cooking rice wine


Fold into wrappers and freeze in sheets. Store in freezer bags. Use within 3 months.

I folded two packs of the wonton wrappers and 1 pack of the round dumplings.  Had about a half cup remaining filling that I cooked and used to make some goat cheese stuffed jalapeños 🤤",1
"this + rice  


so simple yet so damned good",1
can we get a recipe please thanks !,1
Ain’t that the truth!,1
Good luck to your hands! They will need a massage after!,1
❤️🥰,1
"Some tofu sheets can be cooked as is. Some need rehydration. Some need parboiling. Some need to be treated with alkaline water before cooking.

You can try parboiling it first, until relatively soft. Then, stir fry with bell pepper. Season with soy sauce, salt, a pinch of sugar, a pinch of MSG. Finish with starch water.

It should have a tender and bouncy texture in the end.",1
These are ADORABLE! Definitely going to check out your Etsy store 😁,1
Thank you! I hope you get to make it soon and enjoy Grandma's recipe as much as we do!,1
Around 2-300 total... provides 2-3x week meal through spring,1
Also added Sichuan green peppercorn oil! :),1
How many do you make?,1
Thank you!,1
This looks absolutely incredible,1
Indeed yummy,1
These are so beautiful! Great job!,1
