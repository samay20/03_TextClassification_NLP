"This is not the OPs recipe but it‚Äôs my favorite way to do fideo seco:

Fideo Seco (best recipe)

Ingredients
2 medium-large tomatoes about 16 oz. or 2 ¬Ω cups chopped
¬º of a medium size onion chopped
1 large garlic clove
1 Chipotle pepper in adobo*
1-¬Ω tablespoon vegetable oil
1 7.05-ounce package of Fideo (Vermicelli) noodles
About 1 ¬Ω cups of Chicken broth **
¬Ω teaspoon oregano
Salt to taste

OPTIONAL GARNISH:
‚Öì- cup Mexican cream or other thick creams
¬Ω cup of Mexican queso a√±ejo cotija or fresco***
1 Avocado sliced
Chopped cilantro
Red onion slices
Pork cracklings


Place chopped tomatoes, onion, garlic, and chipotle¬†pepper in your blender, then add 1 cup of the chicken broth and process until¬†you have a medium-fine sauce.¬† Set aside.¬†(Please check the ingredients list below)

 Heat oil in a medium-size skillet and then add the¬†noodles. Fry until lightly browned, stirring often to avoid burning the¬†noodles. This step will take about 2-3 minutes. Remove noodles from skillet.

Add to the skillet the tomato sauce, ¬Ω cup of broth,¬†oregano, and salt to taste. Turn the heat up to bring to a boil. Once the sauce starts boiling, add the noodles, reduce heat to low, and¬†cover the skillet to let simmer.

Keep cooking for about 12-15 minutes, stirring occasionally¬†as needed until noodles are cooked and tender.",2
A Norte√±o would disagree with you here.,2
You're in trouble now,2
Cute,2
"Before heating you can moisten with a mixture of oil and water. Don't go nuts, a little helps keep them pliable",2
But in general Ignis_Vespa below is spot on.,2
"I use the Pan for tortillas as its readily available in Ireland and cheaper than Maseca.

You need to play with the temp and quantity of water to get a good result but its possible.",2
The birria you see tends to be beef.  Most Americans still aren't ready for goat.,2
Omfg that looks amazing...,2
Thanks will look!,2
Recipe?,2
I envy you ü§§,2
"I can certainly see the similarities, but chilaquiles are more of a deconstructed enchilada. Enchiladas can be made from any sauce including mole, green chile salsa and even the sauce that the birria is cooked in. I have also had entomatadas and enfrijoladas (my daughters favorite). Nachos are generally made with chips and topped with yellow cheese primarily. Enchiladas are cut soft corn tortillas, fried and then cooked with the sauce (which is mostly absorbed) then topped with Mexican cheese. Ultimately all foods made with tortillas are related :) sorry to be so long winded :P",2
"Don't get me wrong, but at this point wouldn't they be nachos? 
They look great tho and I bet the taste amazing!",2
"Just plain flour, baking powder, salt &amp; pepper and very cold mineral water.",2
What sort of batter is that?,2

Nice.. .,2
Thanks :),2

"Not sure why, but all of a sudden it‚Äôs exploded all over the US thanks in part to social media.",2
It's funny growing up I always thought people here would love birria but the Midwest wasn't ready for it until now.,2

It‚Äôs a white lean meat. When‚Äôs it‚Äôs ground though it‚Äôs not chewy at all and does kind of taste like chicken,2
"Can you please share the recipe? Looks delicious,",2
Make me some plz lol,2
"You can find traditional style (not from corn flour/maseca) corn tortillas in some stores. Try natural grocers, whole foods, or similar if you have something else like that near you. Look for whole corn and lime on the ingredient list. Masienda or Mi Rancho brands are good, and you might be able to find some local brands if you‚Äôre lucky. Some mexican markets also sell fresh masa if you‚Äôre up for making your own.

Second the rolling pin idea and not over working. I know some flour tortilla recipes also skip baking powder, which will give you a thinner style.",2
"I didn't even consider Amazon for certain ingredients.

Thanks again! :)",2
You should! I have the recipe on my website.,2
I NEED TO TRY IT,2
"It's a very lean protein so it mostly tastes like whatever it's been cooked in/with.  It has a bit of fishiness to it and a somewhat tough, stringy texture.  A lot of people will tell you it tastes like chicken.",2
"I think Reddit is so cool like that lol and no. Maybe a wild game cook book one day, but right now I‚Äôm just enjoying showing off my food and building a small following lol",2
"Dude I live in san Antonio, and all the stuff you make looks absolutely amazing! Do you have a restaurant or something",2
Floridian here. To me it tastes like catfish but chewier sometimes.,2
What does gator taste like?,2
Thank you and same! The gator made it a cool variation on the normal flauta,2
My husband is from Florida but I‚Äôm from Texas and the gator was gotten in Texas so I feel like that makes it Tex-mex lol,2
This looks delicious. I love flautas!,2
"&gt;Now to see if I can find the ingredients here 

Amazon has all of those except frozen banana leaves that i think you can get in ultrafoods or some shop like that",2
"This is some Florida Mexican shit, and I approve as a Florida Mexican.",2
Thank you!,2
"You can use maseca for tamales but you'll get a dense tamal. There's also a ""tamal flour"" by maseca that makes the tamales more fluffy.

The real difference is that when you make nixtamal, corn made for tamales is fully cleansed of any corn peel, then dried and milled. Nixtamal for tortillas is not fully cleansed of its peel because it helps with the texture of tortillas.

About the fat, if you're mixing the fat with the masa,  you can use duck fat and if you're using oil I'd recommend you to heat it up beforehand, else you'll get an oily flavour on your gorditas",2
"Ohh, I didn't know that. Thanks!
Is the maseca what I would use for tamales?
Also, do you know if substitutions can be made for 'lard' in gorditas, for example butter, oil or duck fat?",2
"Corn tortillas outside of Mexico are commonly made with maseca, which is a bad product itself. Its a common issue with it, I'd recommend you to apply a bit of water, maybe with an atomizer before heating them up. Unfortunately reheated tortillas made with maseca get hard af after like 10 minutes.

Regarding the flour tortillas, I'd recommend you to use a rolling pin instead of a tortilla press, also don't work the dough too much so you don't develop too much gluten in the dough",2
"Pan brand is for arepas, the corn is not nixtamalized

Maseca is ""nixtamalized"", so its the best for tortillas and gorditas

The third one, IIRC, its for stuff like grits",2
Looks good,2
The gator was taken in Texas and I live in San Antonio so still works as Tex-mex lol,2
"I know many people that buy this just to drink it, you should be fine",2
So.. instead of tex-mex...should be flo-mex? Looks awesome!,2
"Danny Mena‚Äôs ‚ÄúMade In Mexico‚Äù has the best recipe I have ever seen for cochinita pibil. It has regional dishes and great suggestions on the best places in eat in CDMX. Everything I have made from it, has been outstanding. ‚ÄúOaxaca‚Äù by Bricia Lopez, is brilliant too but it is for me, more home cooking so lesser of the wow than Mena‚Äôs. Enrique Olvera‚Äôs ‚ÄúMexico From The Inside Out‚Äù is about half full of easy cooking and the other half, beautiful descriptions and inspirations (following with recipes) more to marvel and drool over, or if you are up for the challenge, to try to replicate at home. I find these three are great starting out. I also have Nopalito, Oaxaca by Ruiz, AMA, My Mexican Kitchen and to really get you planning a trip over after cooking recipes from - David Sterling‚Äôs ‚ÄúYucatan‚Äù. It is just from that Yucatan region but what a region it is for food!",2

Looking for this myself,2
Ay si.,2
Yeah I'd love to get the recipe for the meat. Looks great.,2
I guess we can agree that language is fluid and words and their meanings are always evolving,2
"Barbacoa traditionally is a dish of lamb (mutton? Im not sure of the name of olds lamb meat tbh)  covered in pencas de maguey, cooked in an underground oven. Altough I agree that some people  use ""barbacoa"" as a cooking method, I think it's those people who are technically incorrect. Cooking in undergrounds ovens was a prehispanic method used mostly by the mayans, the underground oven is called ""Pib"" and there are multitude of dishes using this technique and I dont think noone calls cochinita pibil barbacoa de cerdo.",2
With nopales? Yum,2
Jealous!! ü•µ,2
"Can i ask how they cooked the meat?  I have 2 racks of short ribs in my freezer from a cow, the last set I screwed up pretty good this might recipe.",2
"Yes, nothing more mexican than random sweet corn mixed with cheddar, cumin and fritos",2
"Aye, my momma done found me on Reddit. üòÇ",2
"It turned out delish. This is jesstheboymom‚Äôs Mom! After 29+hours of cooking, it fell apart to perfection. With a lil bit of homemade Mexican rice and refrained beans with pico on corn tortillas‚Äôque vida‚Äô! Muah!!",2
Glad to help! :),2
Man I don't care that the post is old I'm glad you took the time to share this gem lol. Better than everyone else acting like idk how to use Google and certainly informative.,2
"The cheek is the best part, sometimes you can ask for only cheek barbacoa... but $$$",2
"Barbacoa is a cooking method, steaming under ground over night. People use the word barbacoa as a dish which is a bit incorrect and most of us don‚Äôt even know it.

It‚Äôs similar if everyone makes a specific steak sous vide(under vacuum) and everyone made the association and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs eat sous vide‚Äù referring to the dish but technically that is incorrect.",2
Oooo üò©üëÜ You should invite me over cuz that looks GOOD,2
Those look delicious,2
OOOOO that look GOOD,2
With bull fighting Chile! Awesome.,2
I remember the shock of coming home from school one day and seeing a cow‚Äôs head just chilling in the kitchen at my grandparent‚Äôs house.,2
"Birria de res definitely exists, but now I‚Äôm thinking about goat jerky ü§î",2
Mole verde is the best,2
"I dont know if theres a special kind of barbacoa in the US where they only cook the head, but in M√©xico they cook the whole animal, so not a lot of cabeza compared to evertyhing else, and most places usually sell you the part you want so you dont get cabeza if you dont ask for it",2
"Yeah, I think in the ground is traditional, giving a moist, tender, falling apart beef!  Not judging! Tasty is tasty!  But certainly the head and neck is real deal!  The meat is also great for tamales! Thanks for sharing !",2
Omggg I want to come over and eat ü§£,2
" No, that‚Äôs an empanada. You can find empanadas literally everywhere in the southwest! Lol! This is different. It‚Äôs more a sheet cake, but the layers are somewhere in between a bread and a cake. It‚Äôs hard to describe.",2
"Last pic has to be one of a face with a mouthful of barbacoa, grease all over the chin and mouth, happiness in the eyes....and preferably, for that face to be MINE! üôÇ",2
It‚Äôs not barbacoa if it isn‚Äôt.,2
"And I promise, it is EXTREMELY moist.",2
Those are the best kinds of pics to get! I love seeing the process and what it looks like at every step!,2

And garlic, also add some chorizo, sausages, onion, chipotle(the canned kind), tomato sauce and ground tomatoes, red and green peppers, small potatoes (don't know what it's their name in english?), And finally 1 beer( the secret ingredient for flavor).

"Well, spaghetti in Mexico is cooked with a thick tomato sauce, similar to red rice. Kids like to grab a tortilla and make a taco with their spaghetti. I did it when I was a kid too.

Again, there's no ""normal"" version because a taco is a way of eating with a tortilla. You can make a salt taco (salt and tortilla) a lime taco (lime juice, salt and tortilla), a salsa taco (salsa and tortilla), a cheese taco... 

A chile relleno taco, a carnitas taco, a birria taco, a shroom taco, a cuitlacoche taco.

A taco acorazado (rice, picadillo, salsa, tortilla)

A taco placero (chicharr√≥n, avocado, salsa, cheese, tortilla)

If you want a mexican dish to make tacos of, you can make picadillo, fairly easy to get the ingredients outside Mexico so I'll leave you a recipe

Ground beef 250 gr

Potatoes, cubed 250 gr

Carrots, cubed 150 gr (Optional)

Jalape√±o pepper, cut into 4  long slices, 1 piece

Tomatoes, roasted or boiled, 4 pieces

White onion, 1/2 piece

Garlic, 2 cloves

Bay leaf, 5 small pieces

Thyme, 10 sprigs

Marjoram, 5 sprigs

Salt

Black pepper

Vegetable oil or lard

Blend the tomatoes with the onion and garlic.

Heat the oil or lard in a pot, add the meat and fry until brown, moving constantly to break any clumps.

Add the potatoes and carrots (if using), fry for another minute and add the tomato sauce. Add 1 cup of water, the herbs and season well. Let it simmer at medium heat for 10 minutes.",2
"TIL.

Taco with spaghetti is something like pizza with pineapple? But I rather stick to the ""normal"" versions. If I figure it out how, otherwise I will just try.

I just think many recepies you find online are not very authentic, so I wanna get some ideas here.",2
"As I said I am not very familiar with the mexican kitchen, it's not so popular here. I couldn't get the proper corn flour, so I ordered just a bunch of things there which looked good. For salsa I will take the 2 I bought already.

Is there one type of taco I can make with the Oaxaca cheese?",2
"This!

Taco is a way of eating.

As a beginner, start with the precooked tortillas and cook them in a skillet until they get soft and hot.",2
"\&gt;  How about that pork that so yummy,

It's called Cochinita Pibil. The secret of this dish is that you respect the recipe and ingredients as much as you can, specially the seville orange, achiote and banana leaves! do not chage those and your kids will be grateful.

"Wtf you dont need all that to make tacos lol alll u need is a tortilla, onion, garlic, cilantro, lime.

"You aren't even reading my posts obviously because I specifically said use bullion or base IF NOT USING BONES. IT WAS A RECIPE FOR CHEATER BIRRIA, WHAT IS SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT? I'm correcting the bad information you are giving. I am even giving you sources from Mexican people and you're still arguing and being rude and condescending. 

I never took any cooking classes in Oaxaca? I ate food from fine dining to 10 peso tacos on the street out there though. I went to giant spice markets and talked to people from there. Most things were heavily seasoned, even the most affordable options. Spices and herbs grow everywhere, for no money!! I don't know how you equate that using spices is a form of hubris. 

 Mole is a national dish which typically has around 20 ingredients, Oaxacan style sometimes contains 30+. Go tell the actual citizens that they are wrong, I'm not offering up my opinion here, we are dealing with facts. Not to mention, tomato paste, onions, a few dried herbs, meat, and adobo is not an insane amount of ingredients. I even specified that it all wasn't necessary but that's what was in the recipe I riffed off of, which was written by a Mexican woman. Those ""chefs"" are Mexicans cooking their versions of Birria. Like I said multiple times, it's going to vary from region to region and even person to person. Some places have factors like economics or availability issues that cause them to make things differently. 

Nothing that you are saying addresses that you are giving out recipes that won't even work due to fundamental cooking technique errors. I'M positive your family is not preparing birria following your directions.

The guy was asking for quick and dirty from canned. I'm sorry that upsets you so much that it's basically destroyed your reading comprehension and critical thinking skills.

Byeeee",2
Haven't had these in forever!!! So good!!!,2
"First, you need to chill. I just finished my beauty sleep and you wrote me a book reply to each of my messages. Please go outside and breathe some fresh air.

Second of all, mi abuela no tenia acceso a todas las especias porque viv√≠a en un rancho en la sierra de Nayarit. She would make simple sauces with few ingredients, and yes, you can make a birria without tomatoes. You don't need broth cubes if you're slow-cooking bones and fatty cuts of meat which will impart flavor into the consomme. 

**I'm sorry they didn't teach you in all of your Oaxaca cooking classes that the majority of people in Mexico don't cook with 20+ ingredients per dish because they're humble, and their food still tastes better than these ""chefs.""**",2

"Homeboy is throwing a fit about everything not being authentic when a) OP asked for quick and dirty, and b) he is giving out worse methods than us",2
" try giving useful input instead of editing your posts to include snippets of what I said, and downvoting me. You are disagreeing with one ingredient in my recipe, while you are spouting off a ton of nonsense. Dried and seeded, saut√©ed, then rehydrated and blended peppers are what I mostly see used, but if using fresh they need to be seeded, roasted and skinned, and not just blended or it will be bitter with not much flavor. But every single recipe, except one, that I've encountered uses dried even if they use fresh in addition! NOBODY IS JUST BLENDING SALT AND RAW SEEDED PEPPERS IN WATER! Wrong on so many levels. I was just in Oaxaca a month ago and ate consom√© everyday for a week, nothing resembles what you are describing.

The thing is, it's a rustic stew. Ingredients just need to be loosely similar to produce a good result. There are many birria recipes that DO use Chipotle. If you aren't making your own adobo, its going to be the closest thing you can find at the supermarket.. It's something that's made differently in different regions of Mexico and from person to person. A lot of recipes become ""Americanized"" due to lack of access or access to surplus. For example, lasagna in the US, Northern Italy, Central Italy, and Sicily are all different, and within those places, every person that makes it usually does something different. In Louisiana, from parish (county) to parish, the ""rules"" change, some people will refuse to eat gumbo with tomato or okra while some say it's not gumbo without those ingredients. I hear a lot of people say REAL birria is made with goat.

The advice you're giving is not going to produce anything reseming birria, hate to tell you. It's going to be gray water with pepper pulp and bitter seeds in it. I'd take my taco bell con Chipotle over what you're describing any day. 

Not trying to argue, but you're giving out piss poor information while being condescending about it. I've cooked professionally for 10 years, and while I can't guarantee my recipe will come out ""authentic,"" (which it was never intended to be), I can guarantee that your method is not only wrong for birria, but cooking in general. Using adobo with one pepper instead of the other is not a huge deal. Using zero adobo and just throwing peppers in a blender with water is COMPLETELY wrong. This dudes birthday meal doesn't need to be ruined by someone who is more worried about correcting people than giving useful information

"No need to be rude. He asked for a shortcut recipe, and I gave him one that didn't require a blender or traveling outside of a supermarket. Besides the Chipotle part, I told him almost the exact recipe that you just gave, and listed the correct peppers used, but in powdered form, because he asked for quick and easy.

For someone that is so judgemental of fudging a single ingredient, you missed out on tomato in the consom√©, which is a critical component. You're also giving bad advice with just using water, if they aren't using meat with bones, they should use stock or beef base, or it will be bland. But with no stock and no umami from the tomato, like your recipe says,, you'll be left with meat in chile water basically.",2
"Writing a bastardized recipe for someone that probably doesn't have access or know/have time to go to the proper places to get certain ingredients, given that they were trying to use enchilada sauce. It isn't perfect, definitely not authentic, and not tested. Most places in the US, you'd have to go to a hispanic grocery, and there are many places where that doesn't exist.

Just rinse the Chipotle off and use a few pieces instead of the whole can if that's too much. It definitely wouldn't ruin the recipe though, and would probably be a good choice if no other chile is used. But this was literally something I tweaked on the spot, it's a cheater recipe, not a correct one. Remember that a lot of dishes were created purely based on what was available. If that's all that's available, I'd say go for it. If the proper stuff is available, then do it right.

Do you have a suggestion on what to use if you only have access to basic supermarket goods?",2

I thought I was having a stroke while watching this,2
There is a thing called queso fundido from Mexico and they usually make it with queso asadero or chihuahua you could sub something Iike mozzarella and put some chorizo in there it's delicious. IMO it's better than nacho cheese. Also for this queso fresco you have try a bean and cheese taco the cheese will soften up a bit but it won't truly melt.,2

If you have a deep fryer or are willing to do it old school over a stove top; then I‚Äôd recommend making your own tortilla chips with salsa. Just grab a stack of corn tortillas and cut them like a pizza then deep fry the pieces. Nothing quite like fresh chips.

"I'll be using equal parts turkey and pork belly up to around 2kg each (4kg/8.8lbs finished ""loose"" meat). 

Grinding them both with a medium die. Mixing well with Curing Salt/Prague Powder #1 (not traditional but important for food safety when smoking at lower temperatures) and kosher salt. 

Making a very thick adobo with 4 each chiles guajillo. ancho, and chile de arbol, 1 head of garlic, 1 medium white onion, a tablespoon of black peppercorns, 4 allspice berries, a teaspoon of whole cumin, 1 stick of canela (cinnamon), and I'll throw a serrano or two into the blender... blended with equal parts of white vinegar and water until thick but smooth (lately i've been cheating by grinding fresh garlic, chiles, salt, pepper, and spices in my molcajete and adding the resulting paste to my rehydrated chiles already in the blender to keep from having chunks of spices in my adobo). 

I then make a patty and fry it to taste for anything (usually salt). 

You then just mix it all up, put it in the fridge to harden, and then push through a sausage stuffer into natural casings. I've seen this DIY'ed with soda bottles where the meat is just pushed through by hand into the casings.",2

"Okay that‚Äôs helpful! For me, when I think about New Mexican food, it definitely makes me think green salsas and fresh chiles. So that‚Äôs maybe helpful for narrowing down what sort of enchilada sauce to make since you said he likes those. Tomatillos and fresh chiles are probably gonna be good bets

Pork chile verde is everywhere there too and it‚Äôs super easy. Definitely use some hatch chiles in the salsa verde if you can find them, though you might need to add some jalape√±os or serranos for heat if you‚Äôre outside the southwest 

Also, homemade/fresh tortillas (or honestly even just figuring out what his favorite brand of store bought is) can be a pretty big way to get some wins. It‚Äôs amazing how big of a difference a good tortilla makes over a mediocre one. Bobs red mill‚Äôs masa harina is everywhere and it‚Äôs really good, and you could try looking for a tortilleria nearby for fresh masa/tortillas too",2

### INGREDIENTS 

[***US Customary***](https://brokebankvegan.com/vegan-chorizo/#) \- [*Metric*](https://brokebankvegan.com/vegan-chorizo/#)

* 5 dried ancho chiles ($0.25)
* ¬Ω tsp coriander seeds ($0.01)
* 1 tsp cayenne ($0.02)
* ¬Ω tbsp Mexican oregano ($0.05)
* 1 tsp cumin ($0.01)
* 3 whole cloves ($0.01)
* 3 tbsp tamari ($0.54)
* 4 tbsp apple cider vinegar ($0.20)
* 1 ¬æ cup water ($0.01)
* Salt &amp; pepper to taste ($0.02)
* 3 tbsp refined coconut oil, divided ($0.42)
* 6 cloves garlic ($0.24)
* 3 cups TVP ($0.54)

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* De-stem and shake the seeds out of all the dried chiles. Add them to a pot, cover with water, and bring to a low boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the chiles are soft and pliable. Drain and add them to a blender.
* In a dry skillet over low-medium heat, toast the whole coriander seeds until fragrant. Once toasted, add them to the blender along with cayenne, oregano, cumin, cloves, salt, pepper, soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, and water. Mix on high until smooth.
* Pour the chile mixture through a mesh strainer into a bowl (make sure to work it through with a spoon or spatula). Set aside.
* Heat 3 tbsp of coconut oil over low-medium in a small frying pan. Saut√© the minced garlic for 1-2 minutes, then add in the dried TVP and stir to coat in the oil.
* Add in half of the marinade and cook until most of the liquid is absorbed. Then, pour in the rest of the marinade and finish cooking until no liquid remains, about 10-15 minutes.
* Serve your chorizo in recipes like papas con chorizo, [***quesadillas***](https://brokebankvegan.com/sweet-potato-black-bean-quesadillas/), soups, stews, [***sopes***](https://brokebankvegan.com/easy-sopes-recipe/), [***empanadas***](https://brokebankvegan.com/empanadas-recipe-with-corn-dough/), or [***tamales***](https://brokebankvegan.com/how-to-make-tamales/). Happy eating!

### NOTES

* If you don‚Äôt want the chorizo overly spicy, half or omit the cayenne.
* For more flavor, toast the dried chiles in a skillet for 3-5 minutes before boiling.
* If you can't find Mexican oregano, the closest sub is marjoram.",2
"Here you go!

For a good simple one take the seeds and stems out of about 10-12 dried guajillo chiles, soak them in boiling water for about 10 minutes, until they soften up. Then blend the chiles and 2 or 3 cloves of garlic with a little bit of the chile water from the pot. You can add a little water at a time until you get the desired thiccness. Add a tiny splash of white vinegar, and keep adjusting the salt until it tastes good. You can also roast the garlic for a little extra flavor.",2

then add the beans to fry, add salt and then I start to mash them. I think the secret is fry them whole before mashing them in the pan. You can also fry some diced onion along with the chilies before adding the beans. Or even some longaniza.

I make frijoles borrachos (drunk beans) in a slow cooker from dried beans. I do not pre-soak my beans they get added to the pot dry with the cooking liquid they need.

**Frijoles Borrachos**

2 cups of dry pintos

6 cloves of garlic (ajo), smashed

1/2 white onion (cebolla), minced fine

3 allspice berries (pimenta gorda), ground fine

1 cinnamon stick (canela) approx 5cm/2.5 inches long

2 tsp freshed cracked black pepper

1 1/2 tablespoon kosher salt

2 serrano chiles minced fine (seeds and stems included, but can be omitted if you prefer not spicy)

1 tablespoon Chicken Bullion powder (caldo de pollo en polvo)

3 bay leaves (hojas de laurel)

1 beer (I use Negro Modelo typically as it's my favorite Mexican beer I can get here)

4 cups chicken broth (or water)

3 tablespoons bacon drippings

&amp;#x200B;

Instructions:

Fry the onions in the bacon fat until translucent, then add garlic, serrano, and all the dry spices. Then add all components (including what you fried up) into your slow cooker. Cook until beans are tender (on mine it's about 6 hours on medium and 10 on low which tastes better to my palate). Taste for salt and add as necessary. Fish out the cinnamon and bay leaf before serving, lest [white people will tweet about tree leaves in your food](https://www.distractify.com/trending/2018/02/19/Z2pwU4e/chipotle-bay-leaf). (this is tongue in cheek as I myself am a white person, btw). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**NOW WE CAN MAKE REFRITOS**

2 cups leftover (cold) frijoles borrachos

3-5 tablespoons lard (manteca) (it could take more, or less to fry without sticking to the pot depending on how much moisture is left in your beans which is why I say 3-5 tablespoons)

Heat the lard over medium high heat. When the oil is hot enough to shimmer, add the beans and mash them with a potato masher or the back of a wooden spoon. You don't want bean smoothies so make sure to keep some of the beans texture together. Add more of the lard if it's too dry in the pan and sticks. Taste for salt and add pepper if desired.",2
"Yo dude, I love making leftovers with taco leavins! And you lied when you told me it was all gone. That's ok, ya gotta protect and hoard the goodness. I do it all the time! :)",2
"I make a basic pot of beans and fry em after I've eaten my fill of a million bowls. If you're talking about how to make beans to fry, I grab a tube of Cacique chorizo and put it in the pot. Heat it up and it will literally melt into a delicious liquid. If you are adding other spices, add them now. I can't eat garlic so don't add any, but add a little bit of cumin, microscopic amount of chili/cayenne powder(young kids), and whatever you like. I add onion powder instead of actual onions cuz I have a picky teenager. She sees suspicious particles in the beans and she won't eat them, even if she loves my beans. 
Your beans should have soaked overnight prior to this. Rinse them out and put them in the pot with new water just til it covers the beans. Medium heat until it starts to bubble, then put heat on low to simmer those bad boys for an hr or two. 
For refried beans, take whatever beans you have previously made, whether they're still whole, half mashed, or totally stick blender-ed like my teen likes em, and put them in a pan that you have heated up with a tablespoon or two of lard(canola/vegetable oil will work in a pinch--im in northern Idaho so sometimes can't find lard) and throw your beans into the pan. Fry until heated if they're cold, or fry until you have a nice thickness going on with your beany goodness.
Enjoy!

Thank you! I'm going to pick up more limes in the morning!!,2
"I do also at times but I once served it like that to a couple of friends and they both were up all night shitting themselves to death. I laugh about now when I think about it. Actually, I laughed about it back then, too.",2
"A tostada; a toasted corn tortilla.
Topped with habanero mayo, brown shrimp, avocado and salsa macha.",2
What is this?,2
"We eat it mostly grey the first round in my family. Nobody has died. 

Do what the other person said about keeping shrimp marinating in a separate bowl first.",2
"lime juice, MAS!",2
Add more lime juice and will be fine,2
\*Newspaper smack* No! Bad! No!,2
"It looks like you didn't add enough lime juice

Funfact: aguachile is practically eaten with raw prawns, no waiting time when it comes to aguachile",2
"Hey! So for next time, I would marinate the shrimp in a separate bowl until the shrimp changes color. Add lime juice until it covers the shrimp, you can always strain it when it‚Äôs done. Typically the shrimp should be done marinating around 15 minutes. Also, if your preparing in advanced, keep the ingredients in the fridge so the shrimp does not enter the ‚Äúdanger zone‚Äù.",2
"More lime and time. I also mix the lime with vinegar from pickled peppers (i.e. La Coste√±a) and always marinate the shrimp first, then, after a few hours, I put the veggies.",2
Lime and time!,2
"It‚Äôs fine to eat shrimp slightly raw. I recommend placing the ceviche in a large flat tray (like a glass baking tray or something flat with raised edges)  so that the juice can cover more surface. If possible, place some Saran Wrap over it but press it down directly on top of the food to create somewhat of a vacuum inside of the tray. This will help the juice to cover the top of the ceviche once you press down on the wrap. 

I hope I explained this well.

ETA: more lime, as another user commented. You can always drain it if it‚Äôs too acidic once you‚Äôre eating.",2
[deleted],2
Don't use raw shrimp! it's dangerous and it tastes way better if you cook it with boiling water.,2
"More lime and let it sit, I typically give it like 3 hours at least.",2
"The lime juice doesn't do a good job of killing bacteria, it's better at preventing its growth and preserving the shrimp.  You will probably be fine, you can eat shrimp raw just like any other sushi.  It's just not done that commonly because the texture is squishy and less pleasant to eat than if it's firmed up a bit.",2
Give it more time.,2
"HALP! So I fucked up while making ceviche! I didnt pre-cook or premarinate the shrimp in lime *FIRST*.
My stupid ass just dumped all the ingredients in the bowl and put a shit ton (6) of *fresh*lime juice amd tossed it together. 
DID I FUCK UP?? AM I GOING TO POISON US? THE SHRIMP IS STILL GREY!",2
Thank you!,2

That's what I was thinking as well. Or just shredded chicken in Chili Colorado if I kept it saucy enough. This is for my weekly meal prep and didn't want to go to the stores on Easter (because they likely won't be open).,2
"Well, yeah, but it‚Äôs obviously not going to taste the same. What‚Äôs going to replace the smokiness of the chipotles? With those peppers it might taste more like chilaquiles sauce",2

"Never heard of it, but it might be the name for burritos in some town. Mexican food is notorious for having different names for the same food in different places. So it could've been someone from a small town in M√©xico moved to kansas and popularized the term. In Jalisco they're named burritos :)",2

"I made this for others who have a low-ish heat tolerance. I still wanted to have the fruity flavor of habanero, but milder.

"Good torta picture, bad name",2
"I love cochinita pibil, both because it‚Äôs delicious and it sounds like Tagalog.",2
"Yesterday I made cochinita pibil, so we had tacos. We had a ton of leftovers so tonight I wanted to try something different, so I got some good bolillos from my local panaderia and made tortas.

I'm calling this the Yucatan-wich. It's a bolillo roll hollowed out and filled with cochinita pibil, homemade black beans seasoned with avocado leaf and fried in pork lard from my local carniceria, citrus-pickled red onions and chile manzano, then wrapped in foil to press it all together and heated through on a cast iron comal.

This is easily one of the top five sandwiches I've ever made, definitely would recommend it to anyone. I used chile manzano instead of habaneros because I wanted a similar flavor with less heat for those who couldn't handle it, but I think I'm also gonna make some of those tomorrow because even though this was so good I think it'd be even better with more heat.",2

* 3 tbsp apple cider vinegar ($0.15)
* 4 cups vegetable broth ($0.19)
* 2 Mexican bay leaves ($0.02)

#### Mushrooms

* 2 lbs oyster mushrooms, shredded ($4.83)
* 3 tbsp neutral vegetable oil ($0.33)
* ¬Ω tbsp garlic powder ($0.01)
* Salt &amp; pepper to taste ($0.02)

#### To Serve optional

* 12-14 [***corn tortillas***](https://brokebankvegan.com/how-to-make-corn-tortillas/)
* Neutral vegetable oil for frying
* Chopped cilantro
* Lime wedges
* White onion, finely diced
* Shredded vegan cheese

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Birria sauce

* De-stem and shake the seeds out of all the dried chiles. Toast them in a skillet over medium-low for 3-5 minutes, making sure to frequently turn them so they don't burn.
* Once the chiles are toasted, add them to a pot with the tomatoes, roughly chopped onion, and garlic cloves. Cover with water and bring to a low boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 12-15 minutes, or until the chiles are soft and pliable.
* Then, add the chiles, tomatoes, onion, and garlic to a blender along with the apple cider vinegar, 1 cup of vegetable broth, and all seasonings (except the bay leaves). Blend on high until smooth.
* Pour the sauce through a mesh strainer into a large saucepan, working it through with a spoon or spatula. Add in 2-3 more cups of vegetable broth, and simmer for 35-40 minutes.

#### Mushrooms

* In the meantime, remove the bottom portion of the oyster mushrooms, then shred them with your hands into small strips. Season with oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat the strips, then set the bowl aside.
* With 10-15 minutes left on the sauce, preheat about 1 tbsp of oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook the shredded mushrooms in batches until golden-brown and crispy (about 8-10 minutes per batch).
* Add all mushrooms back into the skillet with 1-2 cups of birria sauce and cook down for another 2-3 minutes.

#### To serve

* **Quesabirria:** heat a little oil in another skillet over medium. Dip a corn tortilla in the pot of birria then place it in the skillet. While it‚Äôs cooking, add a scoop of the mushroom mixture and a handful of shredded vegan cheese (optional) to one half of the tortilla.
* Fold the tortilla over the fillings and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the first side. Flip and cook on the second side until the outsides are crispy and the cheese is melty. Continue this process until all the tacos are made.
* Serve with a topping of diced white onions, chopped cilantro, lime wedges, and a side of birria sauce.
* **Stew:** serve the mushrooms directly in the birria with a garnish of onion, cilantro, lime wedges, etc.
* **Tacos:** serve the mushroom mixture inside fresh corn tortillas with garnishes of your choice. Enjoy!

* If you can't find Morita chiles, use chipotle chiles instead.",2

The pumpkin seeds make a \*huge\* difference, so don't skip that step.

Note, when I say this is a nicely warming salsa, I mean that in the sense that I think the Korean Fire Chicken noodles are nicely warming, and that raw jalapeno is a nice, mild, crunchy  veggie.

"That sounds good. Figured it was moleish or a Sonoran type.

I think I need something like that.",2
OP you should check out ‚Äúfrijoles volteados‚Äù - sounds like what you‚Äôre looking for.,2
Yooo don't understand the down votes either lol and I'm Mexican but I appreciate it. And exactly! I've seen so many ways you can makes carintas from boiling then frying to slow cooking and frying and in my case baking and frying in the oven. Sorry yall I don't have a authentic Mexican pot of lard handy when I wanna make carnitas . To me it doesn't matter how you make the food as long as the outcome is delicious. Screw food gatekeepers you only limit yourself,2
"After eating carnitas for a few years, I declared that I would make them every Friday on a cold Friday in 2007. And I made the dish, every Friday from then until 2019, when the USDA declared that all pork inspection will have the option to inspect 'internally', by having  the current workers inspect the pork instead, a common practice in a society that puts profit over human life.

That being said, no matter what recipe you follow, there is little variation whether the recipe comes from Oaxaca, MX or Bangor, ME.

I've made a hundred or so of Chef John's recipes, and they're all damn good. He alone has improved my home chef game exponentially.",2
I prefer using butter or ghee for a vegetarian version to add a bit more flavor. Also try some frijoles peruanos (mayocoba) for a creamier alternative to pinto,2
Are you soaking the frijoles first? I‚Äôd soak overnight and then also add 1 guajillo and 1 pasilla. Toast the chiles then remove seeds and stem and cook with the beans,2
"Hey. I didn't downvote you, but from one non-Mexican person to (presumably) another, slow-roasting pork in a few spices is a pretty poor excuse for carnitas. 

Obviously it's not necessarily possible for everyone to cook entire joints of pork in vats of lard at home, but maybe try the Serious Eats recipe which (I believe, but could be equally wrong) is a lot closer to the actual process - https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/07/no-waste-tacos-de-carnitas-with-salsa-verde-recipe.html

Alternatively, dig out a recipe from an actual Mexican person.. I guarantee it's going to be 10x better than that recipe you mentioned. 

On that front, I'm a huge fan of this chef's recipes - https://pinaenlacocina.com/?s=carnitas",2

Same. This is acceptable.,2

"No such thing as ""refried beans"" there are only ""refritos"" which properly translated means well done, not fried. Proper beans are made with lard, preferably with asientos and a toasted garlic. Once the garlic has infused the lard then you lightly sweat some onions but don't let them caramelise, at this point you may add a chile of your choice for flavour be it serrano, jalape√±o, or even a chile g√ºero. If they're pinto beans then you add the beans and some epazote. If they're black beans then you add a toasted avocado leaf. Do no use rapeseed oil, that's gross and wrong, only lard. If you're making them ""chinitos"" (which doesn't mean Chinese it means nappy negro hair), then they will require more lard and further processing with a masher.",2

"Welcome, in short, the way my family does refried beans is more or less like a ""cooked/fried"" version of hummus without tahini. So I would imagine that what works for hummus works for refried beans too, if you're feeling experimental.",2
"Pasilla, ancho, or guajillo.",2
"amazing, i will keep all this in mind for my next batch, thanks!",2
"My family does refried beans a bit differently. We don't like lard, so we use vegetable oil and we don't like runny beans either. When we do the overnight bean soak we flavor it by adding some stuff (not everything at once, but some options include): onion, peppercorn, cumin, bayleaf, garlic, epazote, thyme, oregano and sometimes rosemary. My family also does refried beans with other types of beans besides pinto and black. My favorite alternatives are chickpea and white beans. With chickpea and the white beans sometimes we will use olive oil. My grandpa and I are the only ones in my family that like to add a little bit of dijon mustard to refried beans while they are cooking- it tastes really good with the garbanzo and white beans.",2

"The Mexican markets in my town don‚Äôt have good meat available, unfortunately. For the salsa (which I make often) is roast/grilled tomatillos (sometimes tomato too), onions, garlic, and guajillos which have reconstituted a bit in boiling water. Throw it all in a blender because I usually make too much for my little molcajete. Add salt and lime juice to taste! Skins on the guajillos aren‚Äôt an issue.",2
"I've never heard of a salsa molcajete with chile guajillo, the skins are too thick and I don't think it will turn out well. Chile guajillo is usually used for guisado or enchilada salsa. Molcajete salsa at least at my house is usually grilled tomato, grilled onion, grilled chile garlic and salt. 

Go to a mexican market buy carne arranchero. Salt and pepper. Grill to desired done-ness. Serve on corn tortilla with cilantro onion topped with salsa. No need to go too fancy.",2

Recipe please! My grandpa used to make them with beer and fried into small crispy delicious pieces. He has passed and I have been chasing his recipe ever since.,2
"I agree with you. Perhaps I misunderstood your first comment and we actually agree on this.

I was just saying that one should probably be a bit more skeptic whenever someone claims authenticity in their recipes, but that sometimes it's a bit hard to distinguish actual authentic mexican dishes with mexican-inspired or mexican-adapted ones (which I would call non-authentic), TexMex being the prime example. This difficulty means that people (both offenders and critics alike) often twist the meaning of the word to justify or disqualify a particular dish.

In any case, I'm also glad it's easier to find good ingredients globally nowadays. People all over the world should enjoy more mexican food!",2
"go to [www.rickbayless.com](https://www.rickbayless.com) he has many recipes from his many restaurants for a start.

For me, I grill some tomatoes, jalapenos, onion then run it through he blender, add salt to taste, clove of garlic, lime juice and cilantro to taste.",2
"The word authenticity is always a controversial one, especially when it comes to cuisines that we are not a part of.

M√©xico is a really big country and has a lot of divisions. Regional division, era division, ritual division, festivities division, familiar division... You get the idea.

Now what I'm about to say is always controversial, but I've seen it a lot. People from the US can't decide wether texan and tex mex cuisine is part of the Mexican gastronomy or not. Half the Internet says it is as to justify texmex being ""authentic mexican cuisine"" , while the other half says its not, as to justify that ""tex mex is great because it is its own thing"".

Now onto your questions, flour tortillas were made in the north for 2 reasons: the first one is that the north didn't grow corn as much as the central and south territories, and the second one is that the north didn't have that much of a mixture between cultures. In fact the north had a lot of Germans, French and Spanish, but the local cultures being so aggressive didn't mix with them, so wheat prevailed in there. 

Quesadillas are authentic in the way that they were made here in Mexico, but the word quesadilla actually referred to another dish that originated in Spain. Now there's a big discussion wether a quesadilla most have cheese or not, and while I believe that what we consider now a quesadilla must have cheese, there are recipes from some centuries ago that are called quesadillas and do not have cheese in it. What you US people usually call a quesadilla is what we in Mexico call a ""Sincronizada"". 

There's no such thing as soft shell in Mexico. We have tortillas and that's all. What you call a hard shell taco I call it a badly shaped tostada. 

Pastor has its origins in the kebab, in fact in Puebla and some taquerias in Mexico City you can still find kebab meat sold as ""taco √°rabe"", but pastor is a mexican creation, an adaptation of the kebab meat that originated around the 50's of 60's in Mexico City. 

Birria is traditional in Jalisco, Zacatecas and IIRC, Nayarit too. Its practically eaten the same way you guys know it, but the famous ""quesabirria"" is probably an invention of yours, as I've personally never seen birria sold with cheese. 

Guacamole and chips (or totopos, as we call them) are commonly made for appetiser, so you're right in that. Elotes are commonly found throughout Mexico sold in the streets and ceviche, although being a peruvian dish in its origin, got modified in Mexico when we added chilli. Aguachile is completely Mexican tho, as its a dish that originated in the merchant ships that went to Asia and it was made of marinated fish in sea water and chili.

Flan is not ""authentic"" Mexican, its French. But the desserts in Mexico have a lot of European influence as most of them were invented (or adapted to Mexican ingredients) in the convents. Of course there are fully Mexican desserts, and some that were completely invented by Mexican nuns and some others that have its origins in prehispanic Mexico, but a big part of them are adaptations of European desserts.

Regarding cheeses, yellow cheese is cheddar, so it's either American or British. There's a classic dish from Yucat√°n called sandwich√≥n that uses cheddar slices, but you'll never see it used in tacos.

Mexican cheeses are Oaxaca, cotija, canasto and panela, and I'm sure these, excepting Oaxaca, are variations of European cheeses.

Then you have regional cheeses like ""Queso de cincho, queso ranchero, queso de palma"" that the technique had its origins in European or Middle East cheeses, but became its own thing in here with the ingredients used or the way they're made. Manchego is a controversial one as Spanish manchego is made with sheep milk while Mexican manchego is made with cow's milk.

At the end of the day, Mexican cuisine is a big mixture of prehispanic, European and Middle East cuisines, and you can even find Asian and African influence. 

Its authentic in the way that they were adapted and adopted in Mexican territory and became part of a culture that revolves around its cuisine, but we can't say its not authentic because it was influenced from outsiders and immigrants",2
"Honestly just use whatever cut you like and the seasoning you prefer.

Arrachera is one of the most popular cuts, IIRC its marinated skirt steak made with sour orange.",2
"I think my point was on the concept of authenticity and how people use it. I've seen some serious culinary crimes against nature committed to Mexican dishes and called authentic. I've spent over 20 years in Europe. The worst transgressions were in England.  Although, I did see some crimes in some the states in the North East, but that was a while ago. 

Al Pastor was supposedly done with lamb or goat originally. The Lebanese would not have been eating pork. One of the reasons for the pineapple juice in the marinade is that it breaks down tougher meats like goat. Funny enough, I've probably eaten more Lebanese shawarma than I have Al Pastor and I've been eating Mexican food my whole life. 

Having lived in Europe for over 20 years I'm well aware of needing to make necessary changes. I used to bring suitcases of ingredients over so I could eat all those years ago. Trying to get a white tortilla in London 20 years ago was a challenge. If you could find them they were very similar to kitchen sponge. Imagine jalape√±os that have a sweet marinade. 

Mexican food is the best!",2
"Salt, pepper, charcoal, grillm

Why not corn and flour? I'll have corn. Thanks.",2
"I agree with your second and third paragraphs, not so much the first. Although ""authenticity"" is now commonly used as a buzzword, *in my opinion* it still has a clear definition and provides value in cooking.

It is no secret tacos al pastor are based on pork shawarma brought by Lebanese immigrants, yet no one will say they are not authentic Mexican food. Is a dish prominent in Mexican cuisine? If the answer is yes, *even locally*, then you have some rights to claim authenticity.

Someone adapting a recipe to use different ingredients while abroad or even a mexican chef creating a new dish with authentic mexican ingredients might not.",2
"Elotes/esquites was always a snack really, especially when it comes from the elote guy on his cart. 

Ceviche could go either way, although we mostly have it as a main dish when we make several types for warmer weather days.",2
"Thing is, you have to ask yourself, what do you mean when you say authentic Mexican? Modern Mexico ships things all over the country, and the Mexican people whom I consider culinary geniuses... adapt things into Their own. Authentic can also be pre-Columbian: Aztec and Mayan are examples 

My personal view is its Mexican once Mexican cooks start making it. Best thing is, while something like strict French cooking focuses on using the best Ingredients, Mexicans have taken what they could get, usually what others didn‚Äôt want and turned them into delicious things.

Once upon a time northern Mexico may have been an exclusive for flour tortillas, but I‚Äôve seen them in stores in Quintana Roo and Yucat√°n. I grew up in a barrio in California, and a common after school snack was to take a flour tortilla, heat it over the gas stove, butter it add salt and roll it up. We would all have that in our hands as we went out to play futbol or whatever. 

Listing of tacos was already made. I missed Arrachera in the list. 

Elote... yes. More of a snack when I‚Äôve gotten them. A street vendor travels around and sells them usually with other snacks. 

Ceviche, actually some say was originally from Peru. But again, in my opinion, the Mexican cooks have made it their own. 

List of cheese was also done. But I‚Äôll add that the cheese is more often a sprinkle, more like garnish and not a major ingredient in things like tacos.",2
"We just use salt and pepper, on an open grill. fresh onions and cilantro, grilled green onions, limes, radish slices, a green and red salsa, and roasted jalape√±os or serranos, with corn tortillas",2
"For a long time I always looked for the ""best"" carne asada prep, I tried a bunch of different things. For the last five years it's just salt and pepper- 16 mesh black pepper and kosher salt. Sometimes, infrequently, I'll use Chicago Steak seasoning. I grill the meat over high flame, quickly. That's it. Extra flavors for me now come from salsas, onions, cilantro, etc.",2
"""Authenticity"", to me, is very problematic. There are so many dishes in Mexico that are hybrids. They are dishes that came over with invaders and immigrants.  There are influences from the French, Spanish, Lebanese, the Moores, German Mennonites, Welsh, etc etc. ie Chihuahua cheese is from the Mennonites.  I like to think the Mexicans just make everyone else's cuisine better by adding their touch. 

A good set of cookbooks from Diana Kennedy is very helpful. Although she was born in Loughton UK (NE London), she has probably done more for documenting Mexican cuisine than anybody. I think I'm only missing one or two of her books. The books generally have a small story with each recipe, who it came from, and suggestions.

What makes me want to start throwing bottles of Pabst at the TV is when I see someone making an ""authentic"" guacamole that uses any avocado (ie fuerte) and adds paprika and maybe Tabasco hot sauce, then say ""oh yeah, that is so Mexican"". That just pisses me off to no end. Then there was the time I bought a breakfast burrito that had hard boiled egg in it along with baked beans. I know a breakfast burrito doesn't have much traceable lineage, but a hard boiled egg and baked beans?!?! Ketchup or carrot flavoured wheat tortillas? Just thinking of it is making me unstable. Using regular corn meal to make corn tortillas.

Damn, my watch is telling me to calm down. I need to go sit in the shed for a while.",2

"Actually the white bread rolls are 50% roundish, 50% longish, but with sausage and hot meats, I‚Äôd say the long version is favored a bit. With the frijoles etc. you are right, we would in most cases only add mustard but they are hardly visible in the picture. 

Just thinking of it, I remember now my kids (half Mexican but unfortunately food wise very German) had breaded pork and fries last year in Puerto Angel at the beach.",2
"oh that way. I am pretty sure more cultures have a breaded cutlet in between bread (Katsosando for example) but I must say that most rolls in germany I have encountered are the kaiserbrodchen type, a round, hard roll with fluffy interior; quite different from this soft, sweet telera bread. Not to mention the lack of frijoles in Germany, avocado, salsa and queso.",2

"Carne asada.

Done!",2
"Ingredients:

* 500 grams of All purpose flour
* 1 packet of instant yeast
* 250 ml water
* 12g sugar
* 6g salt
* 115g soft butter

Put the flour, yeast, salt, sugar and water in your stand mixer and mix with the doughhook attachment until a dough forms. If you‚Äôre using your hands, put the flour first, make a little hole in the middle (almost like a volcano), add sugar and yeast in the middle and salt on the sides. Slowly add water in the hole and work the flour in until you have a dough.

once you have this dough, work in the soft butter until the dough has become nice and smooth. Once that is done, place the dough into a bowl and let it stand, covered with a towel, until it‚Äôs doubled in size.

Punch the air out the dough and slice it.
PRO TIP: if you weigh your dough, it will be easier to have equal sized rolls.
Form the rolls into balls and put them onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Use the back of a butterknife and press ridges onto the rolls. This will give them their typical telera look.

Leave them to rise for another 20ish minutes and pop them in a preheated oven at 200 degrees for about 20 to 25 minutes. Take them out of the oven and place them onto a rack so they can cool down.",2

"Aight mate imma tell this if you are going for authenticity: we don't eat ""hard shell"" tacos, it's more a wrapping than a shell and it's always a soft tortilla, if it was hard that would NOT BE a taco at all. At home we make tacos out of either corn or flour tortillas (the latter we sometimes call 'tortillinas', it's a brand lol), but a taco stands and restaurants they are always corn tortillas, and the are kind fried for a moment with a little bit of oil on a frying pan. They don't get hard they just get greasy and that for some reason enhances the flavour haha.",2

"Tex-Mex uses yellow cheese. Mexican is usually queso fresco, cotija, panela, Oaxaca, Chihuahua, etc.

Tex-mex uses American sour cream which tastes more like sour yogurt. Mexican sour cream is more similar to creme fraiche - it's seasoned and has a salty sweetness to it. 

Tex-Mex overuses cumin and cilantro.

Flan and tres leches are considered ""authentic"" as well as ceviche - I believe they're all European in influence. Remember, both Spanish and French influenced Mexican food with new ingredients. We wouldn't have bolillos or pan dulce without them either. Or beef. Or pork.

Traditional meats would have been goats, and turkeys. Some places also eat armadillos, snakes, opposums, monkeys.

"I don‚Äôt think that is a tomato based sauce.  If it is a hot sauce, I did this yesterday...

5 dried guajillo chiles
16- 20 dried chile de arbols 

Roast chiles in cast iron, or pan of preference, over med-hi heat. Flip peppers as they roast and become fragrant. Removes peppers before they char and put in a bowl of hot water. 

Meanwhile, add some oil to cast iron and heat over med-hi heat. Roast 5-6 tomatillos (1 lb?), 2 cloves of garlic and a chunk of white onion in cast iron. I let them char all over and then remove the onion and garlic and place in a blender. Add some water to pan to let the tomatillos steam and finish cooking through. 

By this time the chiles should have hydrated some. Place the arbols in the blender and remove stems/seeds of guajillos and put in blender. And enough water to mostly cover (about a cup) and blend on high until peppers are broken down. This will make make a pretty red sauce. 

Add a small handful of chopped cilantro to blender (I probably used 2 packed tablespoons) and remove tomatillos from them pan and put in the blender. Add about 1.5 teaspoons of a salt (kosher or I used the Knorr‚Äôs chicken bouillon found in the Hispanic section of store). I also added about a tablespoon of an acid. I used red wine vinegar, but you could y use lime or another vinegar as well. 

Blend all of this together over a medium speed until tomatillos are broken down. 

Add more salt/vinegar to your liking.",2
Yes indeed! Tomato-habanero salsa and pickled red onion indeed,2
"So the areas of Sonora, Chihuahua, Baja, and Coahuila all have spices that were Native American influenced (coming from the Spanish and Middle Eastern early explorers). The Native American influence is why you find these spices in a lot of Mexican dishes from California to Texas where a lot of Mexican cultural sharing occurred.

So while some of these spices are not found in dishes in more Central Mexico, it is typically known (at least where I grew up in Colorado and lived New Mexico) that the spice introduction originated with a cultural sharing between Aztec, Navajo, and Pueblo peoples. New Mexican dishes specifically are a fusion of flavors from the Aztec people and those Native American tribes mentioned, where there are more fried breads introduced and also spices like cumin and cardamom. Tex-Mex is an example of trying to move towards the more traditional Mexican dishes that still include those spices. On the East Coast of the US, where we live now, you will be hard pressed to find non-traditional Mexican dishes. I personally love cumin and the spice influences, but understand the cultural history tied to the traditional Mexican dishes.",2

* 1/2 shallot, diced fine
* 1 1/2 tsp coarse (kosher is fine) salt

In a molcajete, grind the shallot, serranos, and salt together until a watery paste. Gently grind in the avocado and tomato.

I guess I just dont care anymore.   I had over 750 upvotes on these tacos over the three different subs I post in.  

If people don‚Äôt like them, I‚Äôm ok with that and I‚Äôm just not going to be engaging in debates anymore with any of the gatekeepers of the culture.  

I‚Äôll still respect it and learn about it, but I‚Äôm not Mexican and that‚Äôs clear.",2
You were supposed to bring those!,2
"Thanks! Yes, I usually eat them as a guisado, but this time I did it different. I was using the pork scraps to render the fat, but I wasn't paying attention and they turned into chicharrones! hahaha! anyway, I had fresh tortillas and fresh  salsa so I made a quick taco.",2
"Awesome, thanks!",2
"I have come to the conclusion that I‚Äôm no longer going to participate in any conversations about my dishes not being authentic Mexican. 

Instead I‚Äôm going to continue to learn and respect the culture, but do what I want with my own flair and my own tastes.   I would be shocked if a NY Jewish boy could ever possibly create anything that‚Äôs identical to what ten generations of Mexican moms have made.

So, if you don‚Äôt like what I post I‚Äôm ok with you and others not telling me.",2
"Looks nice! I don't know if you know this, but there's a very typical dish similar to this called chicharr√≥n *en* salsa verde, in which the pork rinds are cooked in the tomate sauce until they soften. Very popular when having tacos de guisado in central Mexico.",2
I‚Äôd say about 8‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs from Williams Sonoma,2
"I'll clarify. This is the r/Mexicanfood sub. Hard tacos aren't very common at all in Mexico, with the exception of Tacos Dorados which are still made on soft corn tortillas, then stuffed, and pan fried flat.

A lot of the folks here do their due diligence in protecting the image of what \*is\* Mexican food, to Mexican people, versus what is perceived as Mexican food, by American people.

Of those perceived ""Mexican"" foods that are American, hard tacos are likely the top ""offender contender"", followed by fajitas and chili con carne. This doesn't make these foods bad... just not authentically Mexican. 

This isn't an opinion shared by everyone here, but it is a culturally significant notation to make, especially given that despite it's overwhelming United States membership, Reddit is still an International forum.",2

"Keep in mind we bought all of this in our local Mexican grocery store.

Ingredients to buy:
Cinnamon sticks
6 Piloncillo (sugar cane cone) 
3 lecheras (sweetened condensed milk)
2 evaporated milks 
1 gallon of milk (any milk is fine) 
2 bags of pan para capirotada (toasted bread)
Sliced almonds
Raisins
Sweetened coconut shredded
Sprinkles

How to make the liquid mixtures:
‚ùóÔ∏èThe milk &amp; piloncillo mixture each go in separate pots‚ùóÔ∏è

Start by filling a pot with about two gallons of water, place the sugar cane cones in the water &amp; cinnamon sticks, put it at medium/low heat until the water boils &amp; the sugar cane cones have melted completely. In another pot place about 3/4 gallon of the milk, the lecheras,&amp; the evaporatorated milk and put it at low heat until it start to simmer. Make sure to keep stirring so it doesn‚Äôt burn. If the milk doesn‚Äôt taste that sweet you can add some sugar. 

How to start assembling:

Once they are both ready, let them cool down a bit. Meanwhile, start buttering the pans that you will be using. Butter each side of your toasted breads, lay one layer of bread onto pan &amp; start pouring an even amount of both liquids on to the bread (about 3-4 ladles of each liquid onto the layer). Repeat this until your pan is full. When you finish soaking the layer, sprinkle some coconut, raisins, almond slices &amp; sprinkles, wrap in aluminum foil and put it in the oven for about an hour and a half or until liquid mixture in pudding starts bubbling. During this hour and a half make sure to keep soaking the bread pudding in the liquid ( make sure you‚Äôre using a big enough pan since liquid can spill out!), pouring liquid about every half hour or so . Once you run out of the liquid to pour &amp; your bread pudding is semi toasty on top, it‚Äôs readyüòä You can eat it warm or wait for it to cool down then put it in the fridge ( I prefer it that way). Hope you guys enjoy it alsoüòä",2

"You're right, Mexican moms do make dishes with eggs,  chorizo and other Mexican components: migas, chilaquiles, entomatadas, etc. Frittata is not Mexican. Also, you do know that anyone can post anything on the Internet, right? Doesn't make it true. Just because someone posts a recipe called ""Mexican Frittata"" does not mean the dish is Mexican. This is not Mexican Food.",2
"Thing is, capirotada was made for lent, while the most impressive and complex desserts were made for the patronage festivities",2

"I think probably a liter per kg for the cook.Figure on adding a liter or two by reconstituting and blending the chiles/spices, and the meat will lose at least 20% of its water to the consomme. A good bowl of birria (for an adult) should be 85 to 125g cooked meat, 250 to 350 ml of consomme. 2-4 tortillas de mesa (depending on thickness). I'd expect 10kg (boneless) to be able to serve 70 to 100 people. That said, bones and connective tissue make broth sing. 

If you're planning for a party, get the serving plate/bowl you'll be using. Plate what you're planning on making. Get an idea of how much it *looks* like, and how it eats, whether for family or for business purposes. I've catered events large and small and hosted parties and there's nothing like careful planning to prevent problems. 

Regarding using the same amount of chiles... Double the whole recipe.",2
"Capirotada must have hit the scene during a lower bar in the history of dessert making.  And since then there are much more delicious things that speak to my palate.  I'm with you, I'll take a concha or even the sweet potato in brown sugar thing before that.  The raisins alone are kind of a deal breaker for me.",2

"Impossible my tia G√ºera (May she Rest In Peace) was the t√≠a that got down and cooked better than anyone on the block and taught her sisters (my mom included) how to cook.

The texture is one, and to me visually doesn‚Äôt look all that appetizing.",2
Maybe you've only had bad capirotada.,2
"Consider the output. If you're cooking 10kg of beef, how much beef and how many ml of consomme do you expect per person/serving? How many people are you serving? 
Another consideration is that doing batch cooking means you'll need to refrigerate or ice some of the beef to keep it out of bacteria growth temperatures, and will have to plan for reheating time. If your poor can accommodate enough consomme and the beef can be held moist in another container at safe temperatures, this can work. 

Me? Id get a bigger pot.",2

I eat Mexican food a few times a week, I can get it from several different restaurants even if it's not something you'd expect to find on the menu. Most places will atleast have a taco of some sorts.


Mexican food has transcended Mexican culture it seems. Where there is next to no cultural influence the food has taken on a life of its own. Its very popular among most people I know and the local restaurants are definitely capitalizing on that. I'll be a happy man when I can get huevos rancheros or a wicked tostada anywhere I go.",2

"I‚Äôm late to the discussion here but realistically the flavor that the nuts add are minimal, unless you‚Äôre using a lot of them and trying to accent them, like my pistachio mole.  

A lot of the flavor comes from the roasting of the nuts.  

You can substitute them with some Arborio rice, lentils, or even orzo, just by roasting them in a pan to get that nice toasted taste.

The investigation went forward to interview everyone in the school including her.  Her name was kept out of many of the reports for her own privacy.

"There are many vegetarian dishes in Mexican cuisine.  In terms of making tacos (a tortilla with ""filling"" in it), Mexican rice (either white or red), pinto beans (either frijoles de olla or fritos) are a good start.  For example for my veggie friends, when I make Mexican rice, I will put a can of mixed vegetables into the mix so that it's more substantive for them.

Then there are other things like calabacitas en salsa, chiles rellenos (vegetarian but not necessarily vegan).  I also like tortitas de papa con queso en salsa.  You can also try making gorditas.  Picture an authentic pita bread made from corn, like a really thick tortilla.  Then you can put all kinds of things into.  Like beans and quesadilla cheese (not that orange crap people love to call Mexican cheese).  Here's a picture of an authentic looking one for when you make your tortillas.

Also, for breakfast you can do a ton with chilaquiles - different salsas and cheeses. Many are made with eggs but not necessarily.

And then there are the soups.  Mexican lentil, garbanzo, and a couple of others can be vegetarian.  It's customary to eat them with tortilla, taking the soup contents and putting them into a tortilla as you eat.  

Good luck!",2

üëç,2
"AFAIK, mole (or *molli* if we go to the Nahuatl origin) has two meanings: sauce and food (as in nourishment, in Spanish alimento means both food and nourishment).

So we could get strict that a *molli* is a nutritious sauce, and if we consider the historic side, including the C√≥dice Florentino by Sahag√∫n, as well as the cultural naming of moles, they're composed always of chilies (either dried or fresh) and pureed fruits, roots or vegetables. At the most simple one, of course.

An Italian tomato sauce like you indicate, technically is not a mole (if we go full purist, that is, if we don't I'd call it a *molito*) as it doesn't have chilies as one of the main ingredients, but we have a definition for these type of sauces, we call them *caldillos*.

Edit: regarding the ground up ingredients, there are variations that don't necessarily have all their ingredients grounded. A great example could be manchamanteles, which is made of ground chilies but the fruit (pineapple, plantain, apple, peach, pear) is added cubed",2

### INGREDIENTS

[***US Customary***](https://brokebankvegan.com/sopa-de-fideo/#) \- [*Metric*](https://brokebankvegan.com/sopa-de-fideo/#)

* 5 Roma tomatoes ($0.79)
* 3 cloves garlic ($0.12)
* ¬Ω medium white onion, chopped ($0.12)
* 6 cups vegetable broth ($0.40)
* 1 ¬Ω tbsp neutral vegetable oil ($0.17)
* 200 g (1 package) ""fideo"" pasta\* ($0.22)
* Salt and pepper to taste ($0.02)

#### Garnishes optional

* Lime wedges
* Avocado
* [***Queso fresco***](https://brokebankvegan.com/easy-queso-fresco-recipe/)
* Cilantro or parsley

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* Preheat your oven to 450¬∞F, and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spread the tomatoes out evenly on the foil and roast for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway. If your tomatoes are large, you can cut them in half lengthwise to reduce the time.
* Add the roasted tomatoes, chopped onions, and garlic cloves to a blender and mix on high until smooth. Prepare 6 cups of vegetable broth (we use bouillon cubes, but pre-mixed stock also works). Set both of those aside.
* Heat 1 ¬Ω tbsp oil over medium in a large stockpot. Add the dry noodles in and cook them while stirring constantly for 3-4 minutes, or until golden brown and fragrant.
* Pour the tomato mixture through a strainer into the pot and cook for another 1-2 minutes. Add the vegetable broth and bring the soup to a boil. Cover and reduce the heat to simmer for 10 minutes, or until the noodles are al dente.
* Season with salt and pepper to taste, then serve this soup immediately with garnishes of your choice (we enjoy [***queso fresco***](https://brokebankvegan.com/easy-queso-fresco-recipe/), cubed avocado, herbs, or lime). Enjoy!

### NOTES

* Vermicelli, angel hair pasta, or thin spaghetti noodles all work in this recipe\*.",2
Rinsing off multiple times and dry after. I wouldnt use bbq sauce. Maybe some chipotle adobe sauce and smoked pepper powder. Kinda depends on the recipe you want to make. Oyster mushroom might also be an option. (Instead of jackfruit),2
"I think indeed a better cleaning would have really helped since it was a bit ""gritty"". Indeed I made pulled ""pork"" with jackfruit once, but one of the things was that is came out very sweet, but that might have been due to the bbq sauce as well..   
Unfortunately here in Europe fresh jackfruit isn't really available as well, so I'll have to do it with canned as well.",2
"&gt;Interesting. I don't think I've personally noticed this before on sopes/gorditas/etc. I'd love to see if anyone else knows.

I googled ""cebollas rojo en vinagre"" and it seems the recipes came back as chiefly Yucatan. So probably another incident of a well meaning American chef taking something ""Authentically Mexican"" (because he had it in Cancun) and adding it to everything that is made in their restaurant that is Mexican... you know... the Cilantro complex(tm).",2
"Strongly endorse the enfrijoladas recommendation! I had them first in mexico city and now order them any time i find them on a menu, need a blender but that's common enough and 100% worth any extra effort",2
I think proper cleaning the jackfruit if you buy canned does help a lot. I cant buy fresh which would be a lot better. You could search on youtube for good pulled ‚Äúpork‚Äù jackfruit recipes,2
"&gt;Still seems from the responses like yellow onions are sometimes used in Sinaloa, but white everywhere else, except for red with seafood in coastal places.

&gt;How common are the red pickled onions as a small plate condiment (on tacos, huraches, sopes, gorditas)? I ask because I see that in US/MX border city taco stands often but never knew if it was an American adaptation or something used in Mexico.

"&gt;There's no great substitute for lard in tortillas. I've experimented so many times because my sister is vegan. Other fats give okay results but they're underwhelming in comparison

Coconut fat makes a great tortilla texturally (it's more saturated than pork fat, believe it or not) but the coconut flavor is very hard to miss and I ended up not really enjoying them without a really strong flavored filler (I mostly only use flour tortillas for Austin-style breakfast tacos, and they were just too coconut(y) for that). Now I just save bacon fat and use them for [Rick Martinez's bacon fat tortillas](https://www.foodnetwork.com/fnk/recipes/flour-tortillas-7265712) recipe. 

I've never done it, but I wonder if it would be better to use \*some\* shortening and \*some\* coconut fat for the texture.",2
"IF they make them onsite, it's likely. If you are buying prepackaged ones in a Mexican mercado then it's unlikely (unless they are refrigerated).   


The reason? Vegetable shortening is shelf stable. Pig fat has a fairly long shelf life (for an animal product, that is) but tortillas made with it will eventually (3-4 weeks) go rancid especially when wheat flour is added to it... maybe longer if you keep them in the fridge.

You can always ask if there is ""manteca"" in the tortillas.",2
"Enchiladas are easy because you can fill them with anything you like. You can make a green or red sauce. You see already making the tortillas.

"&gt;any sauce made (for Mexican cuisine, don't be a troll and try to call a hollandaise sauce a mole) for a dish is a mole.

Just because I'm a language nerd as well as a food nerd, wouldn't ""mole"" indicate that the sauce is comprised chiefly of ground-up ingredients?

This would mean 4 of the French ""5 mother sauces"" are not mole... as they are mostly liquids thickened with a butter/flour roux.

For the potatoes, I boil chopped, peeled pieces of potato till they're fork tender, then I drain them and saute chopped tomatoes, onions, and jalape√±os in the same pot. When the tomatoes melt and turn saucy I add back in my potatoes and mash it with seasoning of your choice. I would say 2 tomatoes, 1 onion, and 2-3 jalape√±os for every 4 large potatoes.

"Me causa inter√©s el acomodo, si se llegan a cocer bien as√≠? Siempre que hago o he visto que hacen tamales en hoja de pl√°tano son acostados y como en enrejado",2
"There are a lot of mole recipes that don't include nuts. What we usually call mole is the more complex and refined versions, but technically any sauce made (for Mexican cuisine, don't be a troll and try to call a hollandaise sauce a mole) for a dish is a mole.

You can look for recipes of *encacahuatado*, which is a thick sauce made mainly with peanuts and dried chilies. You can also look for green moles, most of them have some pumpkin seeds (the green ones without the white husk, not sure how you get them over there) and if it calls for almonds just don't add them or change for peanuts.

A pepi√°n is also a type of mole made mainly with pumpkin seeds and other herbs, chilies and spices, and some might include almonds but there's plenty that don't.

There's also a mole made with beets and peanuts from Quer√©taro, you can find the recipe [here](https://www.asomarte.com/blog/entrada/214/mole-de-betabel/). It's in Spanish though",2

"Mexican food is by definition fussion food, It has ingredients from all over the world. 

Being said that, Mexican food has it's recipes and those are very well defined, it's one of the best documented foods in the world and also one of the most diverse in terms of regional cuisines. 

Absolutely nothing wrong with making your own versions of food, just don't call those ""Mexican"" because we Mexicans are somehow like Italians in terms of having a certain respect for our traditional recipes.

Sauce up and down the hatch.,2
With your mouth.,2
The only justification I can think of as to why they have this rule is yellow onions tend to have more sugars and therefore lends to caramelization very well. Where as white onions tend to have a very mild flavor and blend well with other raw flavors (i.e. pico de gallo and with cilantro on tacos) without being too overpowering.,2

I have tried this before as well but I actually like having the full strength of the two pickling agents.  The onions are pickled with apple/cider vinegar but the habanero salsa is heavy on citrus‚Äô. I prefer having both equally present in each bite that way. But thank you for the compliment.,2

The tortilla is the only thing I didn‚Äôt make.  There is a place in Frankfurt that makes them fresh to ship.  I freeze them and then thaw and reheat them and keep them warm.  I have done my best with tons of masa harina recipes but the harina here in Germany always just disappoints me with its texture and with these tortillas made by a authentic tortilla company you really get that incredible fresh corn flavor.

"So in that case, the Mexican market tortillas without lard aren't much different than Mission/Guerrerro brand tortillas?",2
"If the tortillas are substantially better than the ones you get at grocery stores or comparable to the homemade ones in restaurants, they're probably made with lard. If they're not overwhelmingly good, they likely are made with oil or vegetable shortening. It should be on the ingredient list either way though. 

None of the Mexican stores in my area use lard in theirs. I would guess it's a shelf stability issue. If I want good tortillas, I have to make them myself lol. There's no great substitute for lard in tortillas. I've experimented so many times because my sister is vegan. Other fats give okay results but they're underwhelming in comparison",2
Most refried beans are made with lard,2
I use white onions for everyone but chicken soup (yellow) and onion soup (red.),2
"Same for my mom, yellow is common in Sinaloa",2
My mother is from Sinaloa and there is always yellow onions there so we use yellow onions.... and red at times. I remember always going thru the road in Sinaloa and they would always sell big huge bags (costales) of yellow onions and in the markets in the area sells yellow onions.,2
"Most tortillas are made with vegetable shortening, if they were made with lard you would notice.",2
"Enchiladas rojas or verdes  or  chilaquiles rojos o verdes. 



Sauce: red tomato if you want red or green tomatillo If you prefer green, onion, garlic, coriander, chilli and chicken stock preferably cubes and salt. 
That all goes into the blender and then you cook it afterwards. 
( If you use tomatillos it's better to cook it all together first and then blend) 

Enchiladas: buy corn tortillas and soften them in the pan with a little bit of oil and then you put the filling you want, can be stringed chicken, beef or choice of vegetarian. I often grill onions and mix them with the filling too. 
Then you fold each tortilla in half and then covered it all with the sauce.

Add : sour cream or if you can find Mexican cream that's the one. 
Cotija Chesse or a salty crumbly fetta if you can't find cotija. 

Chilaquiles: get a bag of cornchips, as close you can get to totopos so they have to be thicker.  Chuck it in the sauce and let it sit for a bit, then you serve it, add more sauce so it's a bit soupy and you can also chuck an egg on top or stringed chicken.
Add: cream, cotija chesse, avocado and onion ring.

You can have this with a side of beans",2
"I love a bowl of beans and rices with some salsa, so filling and satisfying, and delicious.",2
Beans was in my house everyday when I was younger and it got tiring but now I'm older and enjoy eating beans just by themselves and rice. And when I refry them I cut a Serrano chile and let it cook in with the beans. Fry some tortillas and make tostada shells and that is an awesome lunch or dinner for me,2
Not helpful.,2
My husband loves spicey beef caldo. You can also make regular bean cheese and chicken quisaddilas and make really spicdly salsa or guacamole to dip. Also a fave in our house.,2
"This isn't how my family does it, but it looks good all the same. Idk why everyone in here is hating on your recipe lmao. There's no ""right"" way to make anything. Mexico is one of the most diverse countries in the world. There's probably hundreds of different styles of chiles/salsas verdes, and most of them are probably damn good. If you like your chile, then you did it right lol.

I think the addition of flour is a northern thing, and the aversion toward tomatillos might be too. My mom adds flour at the end of her chile verde, which she learned to make the Matamoros way. My dad makes his chile New Mexico style. He uses flour, and he also thinks tomatillos have no place in chile verde (he's wrong). I make mine the Hidalgo way - no flour, and sometimes more tomatillos than chiles lol. All three are yummy enough to draw crowds. All three of us like each other's too. 

My advice as you experiment with chiles verdes: 
1. Get good chiles and let them speak for themselves. My family loves using roasted hatch chiles; nowadays you can even find them in the frozen section of many grocery stores. My husband's family uses poblanos and serranos which they roast themselves and freeze to use throughout the year. 
2. Season with flavors to enhance the chiles, not cover it up. You can make a fantastic 3 ingredient sauce out of roasted chiles, a couple cloves of garlic, and some salt. You can add other things like onion, cumin, Mexican oregano, lime, or cilantro; just don't let them become your favor profile. It might be tasty all seasoned up, but imo, its even better when it's left simple and chile forward.",2
I miss my chilaquiles for breakfast :) Depends of the salsa how spicy you can make it!,2

"Camarones a la diabla come to mind. But increase the chipotles and add more other chiles to any recipe you find. 
The above macha recipe can go on anything. A simpler recipe used in many places is just: chiles de √°rbol, ajo, nuez (or other nut) and garlic. When you cook the Chile de √Årbol, just pass it through some hot oil. Don‚Äôt saut√© it. Just pass it through, don‚Äôt let it get black.

"The only thing to keep an eye on is the cook of the chiles. You can buy pre-stemmed and toasted chiles, those don't need nearly as much time in the oil. Non toasted usually come with stem still on so it needs to be removed and will need longer in the oil but don't leave any too long if the chiles burn the whole thing is bupkiss. You'll know they're ready when it feels like you mustard gassed your kitchen. Super serious on that, open a window.

Also a simple dish that can be as spicy as you like is a guisado. Meat cooked in salsa basically. Chile verde is the example most people are familiar with but you can do nearly any meat, or even veg in nearly limitless cominations of salsa. Just adjust the number/types of chiles you use.",2

"I don't know what you mean by ""spicy"", since some people can't tolerate very much heat at all and others eat 12 ghost peppers for a snack, but your best bet will be to make a sauce from dried chiles. With this trick up your sleeve, you can make a ""mexican"" version of almost anything that your boyfriend already likes. It is delicious when sizzled together in a skillet with meat or vegetables, or drop a dollop into any casserole, or just use it at the table for a condiment. It freezes beautifully so you can make a big batch and save most for later. It's also the basis for the best pot of beef chili ever.

* 6 cloves garlic, unpeeled
* 3 oz. dried chiles (see note below)
* 11 cups water, divided into 8 cups and 3 cups
* 1 ¬Ω teaspoons salt
* 2 tablespoons cooking fat (see note below)

Instructions: In a skillet or comal toast unpeeled garlic cloves over high heat, turning several times to char the peel, about 3-4 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool.

Stem and seed the chile pods. (Note): You may use any kind of dried chile peppers, but a good learner mixture is 2 oz. Ancho chiles and 1 oz. Guajillo (for a redder pure√©) or 1 oz. Pasilla (for a darker, sharper pure√©). Leave the seeds in to make the hottest of sauces.

In a large pot bring 8 cups of water to a boil and turn off heat. Place the chiles in the boiling water (they may have to be weighed down by a plate), put lid on pod and let steep off the heat for half an hour.

In a blender place reconstituted chiles, the peeled garlic, salt, and three cups water (not the chile water) and process for 5 minutes to a smooth paste. Pass the pur√©e through a strainer into a bowl using a spatula scraping the puree down through the strainer. Discard the solids.

In a skillet or pot over medium-high heat, melt the fat. (Note): You can use whatever cooking fat you like, but the flavor will be best (and most traditional) if you use a rendered animal fat like lard, bacon grease, or beef tallow. 

Add the strained chile pur√©e. Reduce to low and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Makes about 3 cups",2

 INGREDIENTS 

[***US Customary***](https://brokebankvegan.com/green-enchilada-sauce/#) \- [*Metric*](https://brokebankvegan.com/green-enchilada-sauce/#)

* 2 lbs tomatillos ($0.90)
* 2 fresh poblano chiles ($0.24)
* 2 fresh jalape√±o chiles ($0.06)
* 1 large white onion ($0.24)
* 4 cloves garlic ($0.16)
* ‚Öî cup cilantro ($0.18)
* 1 tbsp lime juice ($0.06)
* ¬æ cup vegetable broth ($0.05)
* 1 tbsp olive oil ($0.11)
* Salt to taste ($0.01)
* 1-2 tsp cumin *optional*
* 1-2 tsp Mexican oregano *optional*

### INSTRUCTIONS 

* If your tomatillos still have the husk on them, remove those first and give them a good rinse. Set aside.

#### Skillet

* Heat a seasoned cast-iron skillet to just over medium (this takes about 8-10 minutes). If your pan isn't well seasoned, rub it with a little olive oil before heating up.
* Once the skillet is hot, place the tomatillos, chiles, and onion in a single layer on the pan and sear for about 3-4 minutes. Flip and cook until each side is charred and the veggies are softened.

#### Oven

* Turn your oven to broil on high, and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Then, spread the chiles, onion, and tomatillos out evenly on the foil. Broil for 10 minutes, flipping halfway. This will slightly char the skins, but careful not to let them burn too much!

#### Boil

* If you don't have access to a cast-iron skillet or oven, bring the tomatillos, chiles, and onions to a boil in a large pot. Once boiling, reduce the heat to simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the veggies are soft.
* In the meantime, peel your garlic and roughly chop the cilantro. Add these to a food processor or blender along with the lime juice and vegetable broth (**optional:** add in a pinch of Mexican oregano and cumin for extra flavor).
* Once the tomatillos, onions, and chiles appear blackened and soft, remove them from heat and de-stem and seed the chiles. Add the cooked veggies to the rest of the ingredients in your blender.
* Blend on medium-high until all ingredients are mixed together to your preference, about 1 minute (more time for a smoother consistency, and less for a chunkier texture). If it needs more liquid, add in extra vegetable broth 1-2 tbsp at a time.

#### Season

* Lastly, heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high. Slowly pour the salsa in and bring it to a low boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes.
* Once your sauce is done reducing, season with salt to taste and serve immediately over enchiladas or transfer it to a container to store in your fridge.

### NOTES

* This recipe tastes delicious with a pinch of cumin or Mexican oregano!
* If you prefer a spicier enchilada sauce, try throwing in a few serrano chiles.
* Seasoning the enchilada sauce deepens the flavors and creates a more balanced end result.",2
Pasen la receta!,2
how was it?,2
I‚Äôm drooling that looks so good!,2
"Because a) you don't want seed powder making your chile paste coarse and b) capsaiscin is usually stronger in the seeds of any chile, so your dish can get unberably hot.",2
Is there a receipt for this? Looks so good!,2
Why remove seeds?,2
"Thanks very much /u/soparamens, I will update the database accordingly!",2
"Nice, just some mistakes:

* Chacalaca is a wild bird, not domestic. 
* In Yucat√°n, turkeys are called using the Spanish word ""Pavo"" or the Maya ""Ts√≥"" (domestic) and ""Kutz"" (wild, occelated variety)  Guajolote is a Nahualt word from central Mexico.  
* J√≠caro is the tree, the calabash itself is ""J√≠cara"".
* Papadzules is the plural of Papadzul (the master's food, in Maya) and they may look like enchiladas, but are very very different in flavor and culinary technique.  
* Salbut is the singular of Salbutes, ""Salbute"" is a mis conjugation. 
* ""Canela"" is written with a single L
* ""Garnachas"" are not typical from the Yucatan but central Mexico. The name can also be used in all the country as a generic name to any deep fried street food.
* ""Maciza"" 
* ""mulato"" is a calificative, the correct name is ""chile mulato"" 
* ""Paujil"" are not domestic, but wild birds. They are to shy and won't grow well in captivity as other turkeys. 
* Sopa de lima is not made with limes, but with ""lima agria"" wich is a different citric. 

Keep on the good work!",2
Con chamoy?,2
I will look up this 3 2 1 method and implement it next time. The flavor of the salsa was there so I at least knew I got something right.,2
"Thanks! It's inspired me to do similar for other cuisines, too- completed Chinese, now trying Italian :) It's good to have everything you might face on a menu in a single place.",2
This is fantastic!,2
"It seems in my haste I neglected to take an after photo. I did not smoke them I went semi low and slow in the oven then finished on the grill. They ended up a little tough but this was my first foray into ribs. Everyone else liked them but I was slightly disappointed. Next time I think I will smoke them. 

For the salsa:
3tbs achiote paste
1 tbs garlic salt (it ended up needing more salt so probably 2 tbs)
1 tbs peruvian roasted chili paste
1 tbs peruvian roasted garlic paste
1 tbs cumin
1 tbs pepper corns
1 tbs oregano
Dash of clove
1/2 lemon worth of juice
2 tbs sweet and smokey chili flakes
1/4 cup beer
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
2 rings of fresh pineapple

Is there an after photo? Did you smoke these?,2
"Well, that‚Äôs the point of my post. What dishes am I missing out on? I want to find recipes and start trying things",2
Yes like I said... all cliche and boring items.,2
"Yeah, outside Mexico, but here around LA there‚Äôs ton of Mexican owned and run restaurants and they all still seem to offer the same basic menu. Tacos, burritos, enchiladas, mojarra, pozole, menudo, birria, chilaquiles. Those seem to be a given. Some will have their specialty. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a big difference from all the regional cuisines",2
"Are you talking about restaurants outside of mexico?  Because it would just be impossible to list so many dishes, lol. 

Mexican restaurants here are so cliche and white washed, the most exciting thing you will find is birria, and not even goat, but beef.",2
"It's regional, but it also depends on the filling.

And flour tortillas are not white... eating store bought, extra fluffy,  flour tortillas without heating them until browned in the griddle is super white... I've never been served an acceptable flour tortilla in the US with the only exception being los tacos no.1 in Chelsea market in nyc.

The best you can do is buy the tortilla land brand of flour tortillas at Walmart, they are raw and in the refrigerated section, 90s per side and they are done and taste like fresh made.. this will be the best you can find in the USA other than homemade.",2
"You mean in mexico?  It's just melted cheese, oaxaca, asadero or gouda. Broiled with some chorizo in top.

The one in the us is just some crappy mornay sauce, with 'mexican' spices.",2
Nonsense,2
"Yum. Grew up in El Centro, miss that food so much.",2
Oh yeah that's what it's called,2
"Horchata, but they did like a foam at the top that I can tell what it is... It was good though.",2

"Looks perfect, exactly how good (Mexican) food should look. I need this in my life",2
Capirotada.,2
Interesting is this different than capirotada?,2

Beautiful - would definitely eat that!,2
Thanks.,2
"this is such a mom dish, I love it",2
Some people have nothing better to do than try to argue where a photo of enchiladas belongs. How sad.,2
"Made me think in some ladies from Tlaxcala that produce oyster shrooms and they make tons of dishes with them.

Pozole, mole, menudo, caldo de hongos...

They even sell it at a local market.

Personally I don't like oyster shrooms, but I'd eat some if it had another shroom like venadito, blue shroom or oreja de puerco (that's the name, not actual pork ear)",2

"There‚Äôs tons of flavor in vegetable based soups. Maybe not the same flavors and dimensions, but it‚Äôs obviously a trade off.",2
"Miso paste sounds interesting, tomato not that much it will alter the chillies flavor too much.",2
"Dried mushroom soaking water, miso paste or tomato paste all seem like they might be fitting ingredients that would help.

That said, this looks phenomenal and I may try it this weekend.",2
"Problem with pozole is that **is all about the umami  provided by bone marrow**. Even making pozole without bones and just meat would render a bland tasting broth.

I really don't know if the oyster mushrooms can provide such umami.",2

Thank you! I'll definitely be using queso fresco or asadero next time!,2
"Oh my goodness, this looks like art!",2
I must say I hate those yellow cheesy enchiladas as well but this i would eat. Beans look great.,2
"Again, sub says Mexico and worldwide. You are going out of your way to critique post just to do so. Post some of your authentic food if this bothers you. Have a nice one, buddy!!",2
"no its ""BOING"" soda",2
"I mean, you can post your enchilada cheese crunch Supremes or whatever they call it at Taco Bell. They just look like American obesity with those mounds of sour cream and cheap cheddar.

Also, I would argue this fits better in r/americanfood since it's the type of food you mainly find in American restaurants.",2
Yup.,2
Super Mex is my spot I don't give a fuck it u don't like it was  good......always is good...... authentic or not in your eyes......fuck u if u don't like it....eat elsewhere bitch !,2
"Well, seeing how tex mex originated from mexican descent, it is a branch of Mexican food. Also, nowhere on this sub does it say ""authentic or else"" so your comment bares no weight. Thanks for the feedback though.",2
La tuya. La que chupa la patruya.,2

"""Taco seasoning"" doesn't exist in Mexico just like curry powder doesn't exist in India.

Every family has their own marinades and rubs. As long as you got salt, your food is seasoned.",2

#### Mushrooms

* 27 oz oyster mushrooms ($3.99)
* 1 tbsp olive oil ($0.11)
* Salt and pepper to taste ($0.02)

#### Broth

* 2 30 oz cans hominy, drained and rinsed ($2.59)
* 8 cups vegetable broth ($0.37)
* 3 bay leaves ($0.02)
* 5 guajillo chiles ($0.20)
* 4 ancho chiles ($0.20)
* 3 arbol chiles *optional* ($0.06)
* 1 large white onion ($0.24)
* 8-10 cloves garlic ($0.40)
* 1 tbsp cumin ($0.03)
* 2 tsp Mexican oregano ($0.06)
* 1 tbsp olive oil ($0.12)
* 2-4 tsp salt to taste ($0.01)

#### Garnishes optional

* Shredded cabbage or lettuce
* Sliced radishes
* Diced white onion
* Avocado cubes
* Lime wedges
* Tostadas or tortilla chips
* Mexican oregano

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Mushrooms

* Preheat your oven to 425¬∞F and grab out 2 baking sheets. Remove the bottom portion of the oyster mushrooms, then shred them with your hands into small strips.
* Toss the shredded mushrooms in olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Spread them out evenly on 2 baking sheets and roast for 20-25 minutes, mixing halfway.

#### Broth

* In the meantime, drain and rinse both cans of hominy. Transfer to a large stockpot with the vegetable broth and bay leaves. Bring to a low boil, then turn the heat down to simmer.
* **Optional:** you can blend about 1 cup of hominy with some broth and add it back to the pot if you prefer a slightly thicker broth.

#### Salsa

* De-stem and shake the seeds out of all the dried chiles. Toast them in a skillet over medium-low for 3-5 minutes, making sure to frequently turn them so they don't burn.
* Once the chiles are toasted, add them to a pot with the roughly chopped onion and garlic cloves. Cover with water and bring to a low boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 12-15 minutes, or until the chiles are soft and pliable.
* Then, add the chiles, onion, and garlic to a blender along with 1 ¬Ω cups of the cooking water, cumin, and Mexican oregano. Blend on high until smooth.
* Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a saucepan over medium. Pour your salsa into the pan, bring it to a low boil, then reduce the heat to simmer for 10-15 minutes.
* **Note:** you can pour your salsa through a strainer if there are small chunks, but we don‚Äôt find it necessary with our Vitamix.
* When the salsa has reduced, add it to the large stockpot with the hominy and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Lastly, add in the cooked mushrooms and simmer for another 5-6 minutes.
* Season the pozole with salt, then serve with your choice of garnishes. Our favorites include shredded cabbage, sliced radishes, fresh white onion, lime, homemade tortilla chips, Mexican oregano, or cilantro. Enjoy!

### NOTES

* If you don‚Äôt like spicy food, make sure you omit the arbol chiles.
* You will need quite a bit of salt for this recipe. Start with the 2 tsp, and work your way up from there.

"Thanks for the CV. Again, I would ask whoever made it because as someone who has had birria for their entire life for every occasion for the past 30 or so years since I could eat solid foods have never seen nor heard of a recipe that has rum, aguardiente, etc.

Also same, nothing better than a cobra‚Äôs fang or a Demerara dry float.",2
"I've made and ate lots of birria. I'm a crazy foodie and even crazier cook. I was also a bartender once upon a time ago. My passion is rum based ""tiki"" drinks. The old school boozy kind not the pink sugary type. I'm 99% this has rum in it.",2
"I would go back and ask if it did. I‚Äôve never seen any recipes for birria with rum or any spirit. Chances are it‚Äôs a combination of the spices that maybe tasted similar (clove, cinnamon, marjoram, peppercorns).",2

"Yeah, I'll say it depends on the stands. I've had tacos √°rabes in Mexico City and it was just the pork kebab style and regular pastor at the same stand, but they served their √°rabes in a regular tortilla. And the time I went to Puebla I didn't eat tacos but ate a cemita with ""carne √°rabe"", so I'm not really sure regarding the pita bread.",2
√ìrale!  Tengo muchas ganas de ir a la Feria de San Marcos. ¬ø Hay alg√∫n platillo t√≠pico de all√° de que tal vez yo no sepa?,2
Si!,2
"Hmm...that‚Äôs interesting.  My experience with tacos al pastor in Puebla is different.  I wonder if it‚Äôs just difference between different restaurants/ stands.  The ones I‚Äôve had all seemed to have the same spices as CDMX, and I always thought the ‚Äúarabe‚Äù referred to the bread they use to serve it, which is more like a pita, not a tortilla.",2
"I‚Äôm surely still learning so Im not sure im the best resource, but I have some go to ones. 

I‚Äôm a big Bobby Flay fan and he has some great books on ‚Äúsouthwest cuisine,‚Äù not necessarily authentic Mexican. There‚Äôs a great cookbook called Nopalito, by Guzman, that I really like.  For anyone that has Roku,‚Äôthere are several Mexican Cooking series that I‚Äôve learned so many techniques from.  

Most of my mole sauces are inspired by a restaurant called Red Iguana in Salt a Lake City. My wife hand cooked their full menu for me to use as a base of knowledge.",2
I'm quite noob when it comes to mexican cooking but I love the flavors of mexican food. Any recommended resources/recipes for fool-proof mexican food?,2
"No I kept the masa, but whipped the egg whites!",2
Keto people are the new vegans...,2
"""whipped up' this looks like a MASTERPIECE! I am having this mexican inspired keto dish (https://www.kitchenful.com/lp/recipe/keto-taco-skillet-1723/rcm6) and would die for something like this on the side. I am just not the best cook, but will attempt it. Thanks for sharing!",2

Chile y limon? Like jicama?,2
I can relate!,2
I did the same. I've made it 3 or 4 times this past year. Killer stuff.,2
"I'd differ here, as tacos in Puebla are way more similar to kebabs, without the axiote and orange paste/mixture used for pastor and they're even called ""arabes"".

It's also more accepted that the best pastor tacos are from Mexico City, but I'm sure you can find amazing in Tijuana and Puebla",2
"Mom went to the Mexican grocery today. We are southeast Asian so we are familiar with green mangos which are eaten with fish sauce or spicy salt. I was trying to find a Mexican recipe or method of eating but couldn't find it on google. I searched for mango ""verde, inmaduro, joven"" but could not find a hit. You guys know?",2
In Tijuana they don‚Äôt even call in al pastor right? it‚Äôs adobada. Born in TJ raised in AZ but my family made sure we went back every year to visit and LOL I was in for a shock when I finally went to CDMX and no where said adobada and then I got the sigh of relief seeing tacos al pastor LOL.,2
People in Puebla might object to you attributing the invention of tacos al pastor to CDMX.,2
"I think it‚Äôs because tacos in general have become so popular in the US and Birria is something completely new to a lot of Americans that aren‚Äôt as familiar with the food scene in Mexico. Plus social media and food bloggers started posting about it more and more in the last couple of years creating a major trend online.

But what I find interesting is that where I grew up in California Mexican restaurants have always had Birria soup, served with garnishes and extra tortillas on the side. But Tijuana style Birria tacos with cheese and a cup of consume on the side for dipping didn‚Äôt start showing up in California until the last few years.",2
"I read about it, researched and then made it. I don't think there is an easy way of doing it but also wasn't looking to do so either. Check my profile for recent birria pics. I thought it was fucking excellent",2
"So, like, do it the way you want it, and to hell with the rest?  Also, if I wasn‚Äôt able to make food that I read about or saw on tv, that would seriously limit my growth.  Probably more so for others.  Some ridiculous gatekeeping here.",2
"i am actually totally over birria in the states. we have people who have literally only read about it or seen it on tv making it and selling it. 

it has spread so fast but is getting watered down and bastardized along the way.

personally i love it when it's done well. but, lately i haven't been seeing much of that outside where i am used to seeing it.",2
"Tijuana borders wit the US,  As simple as that.",2

At the end of the day, I'm sure Tijuana already made its own variation of birria, and being the closest place to the states became the popular one over there, but again as I said, as far as I remember only Jalisco and Zacatecas were the only ones with birria. Time to add Tijuana too.",2

Whether you have a cup of water or two cups, it‚Äôs going back into the frying pan anyway, and you can reduce it to the consistency you want.  

I find that the less water you can get away with at that stage the better, because you really want to be able to ‚Äúcook‚Äù the peppers in the pan a bit, rather than just have them boil.  You can then add water to make it thinner after a few minutes of actually cooking it.

"Based on the paper and the plastic plate under it, this looks like a purchased, not homemade item. I don't know about in Atlixco (in Puebla), but in Oaxaca they're usually thicker tortillas, cooked on a *comal* (griddle) over gas, wood or charcoal.

As they're cooking on the comal, the sides get pinched up like *pellizcadas*, and then spread with a bit of *asiento* (the delicious bits at the bottom of a carnitas pot, like a schmaltz), and then topped with a bunch of fun stuff, usually starting with well seasoned refried beans, a bit of cheese, perhaps lettuce, and of course the salsa of your liking.",2
\^This. Turkey and anything of the darker mole and chilmole dishes pair really nicely. At our house we make enmoladas de guajolote whenever turkey is on sale around the US holidays.,2
Oh my god...that looks delicious!,2
"I don't care for them, either. I'd rather go get a good tostada or if i'm going to indulge in comida *chatarra*, I'll have some tosti-elotes.",2
"For those not in the know:

&amp;#x200B;

A few different names for these. Chicharron Preparado, Duro, Chilindrina (Juarez/Northern Chihuahua I think?) or Chimichanga (Sinaloa) I know them best around the Comarca Lagunera (Torreon, Gomez Palacio, Lerdo) and there, they're called ""duros"". They're effectively chicharron made from wheat flour. The same same paste used for these appears in rueditas (wagon wheels) as well. This is a food you'll see along a park, at a kiosko in a plaza, or at the kind of place that sells bionicos, tosti-elotes, etc.

The good ones are using nice pickled cueritos, cream, shredded lettuce (or occasionally cabbage) queso fresco or pulled oaxaca (in fine shreds like a string cheese) and then get topped with a vinegary salsa and some fresh squeezed lime. In Culiacan (and much of Sinaloa and Sonora), you're likely to see them with much more elaborate ingredients available. Ham and cheese, chopped frankfurter/hot dog (aka wini, salchicha), cucumber, shredded carrot and then on.

Totally possible that others have different observations or experiences.",2
"Thanks for the tips.

Baked them for much longer and didn't know about the magic spatula trick.

I have hope now!",2
"If you're trying to replicate what they're making, I suppose you should use the cheese he recommended. When you say ""soft shell"", I believe you're referring to what's called a tortilla.

Generally speaking you're going to see two kinds of tortillas in Mexico: corn and flour. Corn will either be made with ""maseca"" or from ground nixtamal. Flour will be made from either bleached or unbleached ground wheat. Whole wheat tortillas are uncommon. 

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding the cheese:

""White American"" is not a cheese I'd aim to use in Mexican food any more than I'd use Velveeta. Here's a link to a decent article about Mexican cheeses:  
[https://www.thespruceeats.com/brief-tour-of-mexican-cheeses-4118015](https://www.thespruceeats.com/brief-tour-of-mexican-cheeses-4118015)

&amp;#x200B;

If you're looking for melty cheeses, asadero, Chihuahua (occasionally called chester), Oaxaca and Manchego (from cow's milk) would be the cheeses to look for.

Otherwise, crumbly cheeses like queso fresco, cotija, queso de cincho etc.",2

"I like the carne asada idea. Its hard to beat and not that difficult to make since it's basically grilled steak seasoned with chiles and topped with a salsa.

Another simple alternative would be tacos. You can guests customize their taco by having an assortment of toppings. You could even have a choice of protein (chicken, steak, ground beef, beans). And maybe a pinto or black bean soup. And maybe even some nachos or just chips and salsa.",2
Thanks for posting. Super relaxing video,2
Authentic Mexican tacos usually don‚Äôt have any cheese at all. If it like a quesadilla situation it would have melted cheese if not melted then cojita or queso fresco,2

"Hmm, I‚Äôm not sure. Just don‚Äôt burn the chips? My mom always threw in one piece to test the oil before cooking all of them. I see a lot of ppl, especially in restaurants, will take the chips and just toss them in sauce in a big mixing bowl. So they‚Äôre all crispy but the sauce isn‚Äôt hot. That‚Äôs my biggest peeve when ppl make this. Cook the chips, put your sauce, put your cheese, then put a lid on the pan and simmer the sauce until the cheese just starts to melt. That‚Äôs how I made these. In the time that you cook your eggs, they‚Äôve simmered enough",2
Interesting. I usually make my own chips when I can too so maybe I‚Äôll go that route. Might just have give it a go this weekend. Any quick tips for a first go?,2

"The chips are mostly soft but it is not at all the consistency you would imagine when you think of soggy chips. Also I‚Äôve found that the texture is the best when I fry the corn tortillas myself instead of buying the chips, and then simmer them in the sauce. It also helps me control the salt level.

If you have a place that sells the good chips though then no need to go through the extra steps.",2
This is my favorite meal. I eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner (although not that often because I like to keep it as a treat) it‚Äôs so cheap to make too. You did it exactly the way I like it too.,2

"This looks amazing.  I've never had chilaquiles.  They always look delicious, but is the consistency not just like a bunch of soggy chips?",2
I usually use leftover salsa from things like enchiladas or whatever I had the night before for chilaquiles! It always turns out pretty good!,2

"&gt;It seemed rare to find dishes that had a completely different flavor profile.

Check out Yucatan Cuisine. It's very different from the rest of the country.   


\&gt;  When growing up in Mexico and living day to day life, did moms try and mix it up each night or did it seem relatively similar day to day? 

At least where i come from, traditional moms cook a specific dish per day, and leave some more elaborate ones to buy on weekends. for example

Monday - Frijol con puerco, a Portuguese/caribbean dish [https://yucatantoday.com/frijol-con-puerco-beans-pork-recipe/?lang=en](https://yucatantoday.com/frijol-con-puerco-beans-pork-recipe/?lang=en) It's eatenj on Monday because for a mom that's the busiest day of the week, so it's the easiest dish.  

 Wednesday - Papadzules [https://www.rickbayless.com/recipe/papadzules/](https://www.rickbayless.com/recipe/papadzules/)

Vegetable cream, with some ‚Äúcueritos ‚Äú ( really old and dirty, pork skin pickled) some yellow cream , according seller cheese, and beans.

"Carne Asada

Skirt or Flap Steak, salt+peppered, grilled over oak lump charcoal and served with a good tomatillo salsa, chopped cilantro, limes, chopped onions, and tortillas for Tacos Carne Asada is about as easy as it comes.

&amp;#x200B;

Al Pastor (home chef version)

Grind a tablespoon of dry annato into a powder (use a coffee grinder preferably), add to a blender with one small can of chipotle peppers in adobo (use the adobo too), one small can of unsweetened pineapple, and a couple cloves of garlic. Blend until a very smooth paste, salt+pepper to taste, and marinate very thinly sliced pork (preferably shoulder) with it for at least 3 hours but preferred overnight. Grill this pork over charcoal for an ""approximation"" of al pastor that will be better than any other rendition you can make at home without owning a trompo/schwarma spit. As with the carne asada above, serve with the typical taco accoutrement (salsa, lime, cilantro, onions) but also include sliced (and grilled) chunks of pineapple to go with.",2

"It would be very difficult to nail down an exact amount of water per *pepper* because every pepper is going to be a different size, and the next batch you buy will be different again, and so on. Buy a digital kitchen scale and measure their weight so you can be precise.

To start you off, try this:

In a skillet or comal toast 5 unpeeled garlic cloves over high heat, turning several times to char the peel, about 3-4 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool.

Stem and seed 3 oz. chili pods. A good beginner ratio is 2 oz. Anchos and 1 oz. Guajillo. In a large pot bring 8 cups of water to a boil and turn off heat. Place the chilis in the boiling water (they may have to be weighed down by a plate), put lid on pod and let steep off the heat for half an hour.

In a blender place reconstituted chilis, the peeled garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and three cups fresh water (not the soaking water) and process for 5 minutes to a smooth paste. Pass the pur√©e through a strainer into a bowl using a spatula scraping the puree down through the strainer. Discard the solids.

In a skillet or pot over medium-high heat, melt 2 Tablespoons lard or tallow. Add the strained chile pur√©e. Reduce to low and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and allow to cool.

This will make about 4 cups of sauce. You can add a few spoonfuls of sugar if you find the sauce is bitter.",2

Some of the consomme Ive seen made is really runny and clear looking and seem lacking, so I think tomatoes would be good. Definitely going to give this a try and get the ingredients this weekend.",2

"I think you really need the tomatoes. They end up in the blender so he'll never know they're there. And no, it does not taste like pasta sauce; it tastes like chile sauce.",2
"buy some epazote, cilantro, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds and mint to make some pozole verde",2
"it's a lot of work to split, stem, seed, roast, soak, blend, and strain but if you like chiles its worth it",2
"lol. yeah, good idea",2
Maybe cut it down to 2 tomatoes vs the 4 it calls for. I've seen other recipeswith tomato paste as well. You can always unthicken with beef stock. I enjoyed it a little on the thicker side for dipping (insert that's what she said),2
hmm. Ill have to give it a try.  I think the tomato would add great flavor. My bf hates tomatoes. thats why I'm trying to decide which recipe to use.,2
Check to see if they have fresh tortillas and chips from a local bakery. Also get the crema and check out the cheeses.,2
so I really want to make these. Ive seen it made with and without tomatoes and now I don't know which way to make it! have you made it without tomatoes? does making it with tomatoes make the sauce like pasta sauce?,2

Got any baking soda?,2
"Absolutely. I‚Äôm going to give you general ingredient list rather than amounts because when I cook I never do things the same way twice. It‚Äôs all going to start with a bag of ore-shelled pistachios.  

Toast a cup of pistachios, with some pepitas, and almonds and set those aside.  

Then cook up onions, garlic, tomatillo, half a plantain, yellow chili peppers, a yellow bell pepper, sesame seeds, golden raisins and maybe one or two lighter color dried chili‚Äôs like hatch or guajillo.  (You can use anchos but if you do the sauce takes on a more red color and I prefer it yellower.) I‚Äôll add a couple cups of chicken broth to make it easier to blend and get the texture right. Towards the end I add some cilantro and marjoram.  Next I put the toasted nuts in the blended to turn them into a fine powder.  Then all the rest goes into the blender on high for a few minutes.  Then I put it through a food mill and into a pot.  It should be really silky at this point.   Now i season it for taste with salt and pepper, coriander, and anything else I want.  I‚Äôll let it simmer for a while like this do the flavors can marry each other.  The goal is to let it cook so it‚Äôs ok to boil it until it‚Äôs thick, add water to it to thin it and do it again.  You really want the flavors to cook together in a nice simmer for a while.  

Lastly, I‚Äôll add a few bars of white chocolate and let that melt in. You never want to boil it once the chocolate is in it.  

That can be stored for weeks in mason jars in the fridge. 

To cook with it, and make a chicken mole for example, I‚Äôll season chicken thighs with salt and pepper and put them on a really hot oiled pan, skin side down and cook until the skin it crispy.  Then I flip the chicken skin side up and pour the mole on top and let it simmer on low for a while.  

When I serve it I sprinkle crushed pistachios on top. 

You can obviously make it more spicy just by adding some red pepper flakes or habanero peppers.  I tend to keep this one pretty mild. 

Hope that give you a starting point.",2
Get some seasoned al pastor meat. Fry in a pan. Top quality.,2
"you picture is perfect, but those seem to be on the drier side. More salsa!",2

"Holy shit American food is cheap. Here in NZ the tomatoes, garlic, onion and oil would be about 3x the price (in season - much worse in winter for the fresh stuff), I'd have to substitute those chillies, even dry, and what I could get would be like $5-10, and I doubt I could find epazote even in a specialty Mexican shop (I've been, never saw it). And I'd have to make my own corn tortillas, masa would be about $3/lb.

I'm jealous.",2
"I‚Äôve done that as well.   Gluten free flour is basically a combo of rice flour, tapioca starch and some other things. We use it all the time.  So much so that we make our own using the America‚Äôs Test Kitchen gluten free flour recipe.   Masa is also gluten free and gives more of a flavor element than the regular gluten free flour.  I also sometimes do it with a mix of 2/3rds Parmesan cheese and 1/3 gluten free flour.  

The egg whites are a great idea.  I do that often with larger batches of chicken and fish.  

Thanks for the help.",2
"Can I offer a suggestion. Lightly dust the Chile in gluten free flour then dip into eggs and fry. But first, separate some egg whites, whip them until you get stiff peaks, then whip back in the yolks. You‚Äôll get a much fluffier and lighter end result. Also, the traditional way, the only change would be GF flour for AP flour",2
I just substitute the wheat flour for masa.  My wife has celiac and so everything has to be gluten free.,2
Where did you find a recipe that called for masa for the chile? I‚Äôve never seen that before,2
Egg wash and masa,2
Wow! Legit!,2
What‚Äôs the batter on the Chile?,2

"This is different than Mexican crema and creme fraiche though, I think the comment about the culture being different is right. Part of it is probably a high fat content too but the cheesy taste has to be something else",2
"Here is the thing, when you are taking 'mexican crema' the closest equivalent in the US is a good creme fraiche, we also have heavy cream and sour cream. 

Most of the 'mexican crema' you find here is nowhere to be found in M√©xico.

More than likely it tastes better because it had more fat content.",2

* [***Mexican crema***](https://brokebankvegan.com/vegan-mexican-crema/)

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Skillet

* Remove the stems and seeds from the guajillo and arbol chiles. Toast them in a skillet over medium-low for 3-5 minutes. Make sure to turn your chiles frequently to prevent burning.
* Then, cover them and 2 of the garlic cloves with water and bring to a low boil. Once the water is boiling, lower the heat to simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until the peppers are softened.
* Next, preheat a seasoned cast-iron skillet to just over medium. If your pan isn't well seasoned, rub it with a little olive oil before heating up.
* Once hot, pan roast the whole tomatoes, onion quarters, and serrano chile for 5 minutes on the first side. Flip and cook for another 5 minutes, or until the skins are blackened and the insides are soft.

#### Boil

* If you don't have a cast-iron skillet, add all veggies (including the dry chiles) to a large pot with enough water to cover them. Bring everything to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer for 15 minutes.
* When they are done boiling, drain the water, but save it in case your salsa needs more liquid.

#### Blend

* De-stem the serrano if you‚Äôre using one and add all the drained veggies plus the last clove of garlic to a food processor or blender. Blend until the salsa is to your preferred texture, approximately 30-60 seconds. Set aside.

#### Tortilla Chips

* Heat about 2-3 inches of vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high (the oil should be at 350-375¬∞F).
* Cut your [***corn tortillas***](https://brokebankvegan.com/how-to-make-corn-tortillas/) into quarters and fry in batches until golden brown on each side. Transfer the cooked tortilla chips to a paper towel-lined plate to cool. Continue this process until all the tortillas are fried.

#### Assemble

* Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large pot over medium. Slowly pour the salsa in with 1-2 sprigs of epazote. Simmer together for 10-12 minutes.
* Once your sauce is done reducing, season with salt and mix in the tortilla chips.
* Serve your chilaquiles immediately topped with [***queso fresco***](https://brokebankvegan.com/easy-queso-fresco-recipe/) or [***cotija***](https://brokebankvegan.com/vegan-cotija-cheese/), [***Mexican crema***](https://brokebankvegan.com/vegan-mexican-crema/), fresh onions, diced avocado, etc. To make this a heartier meal, serve it with a side of [***refried beans***](https://brokebankvegan.com/how-to-make-refried-beans/). Enjoy!

### NOTES

* If you don‚Äôt like the pungent flavor of garlic, boil all 3 cloves before blending.
* If you're short on time, you can use store-bought tortilla chips in your chilaquiles recipe.
* We did not include the oil for frying in the total cost of this recipe since we reuse the oil in our deep-fryer.",2
"Yes both. If possible use whole spices (cloves, cinnamon stick, cumin seeds, peppercorns), and as suggested, toast in dry skillet for 1 minute, then add oil and saute together with onions/garlic etc.",2
That would be awesome!,2
"Can try to make a video of press in action Thursday or Friday. Will post it to this forum. I will be needing more tortillas by then. So much better than grocery store, at least here in Alabama. One of my sons lives in Houston and he can buy good tortillas.",2
"Yes, I made some pork chili verde and bought some Crema Mexicana.  I poured it in expecting it to be similar to Crema Oaxaquena, and was disappointed when it turned out to be just like regular whipping cream.  Instead of enhancing my stew it just diluted it.",2
"That makes so much sense! They must be using a different culture to make it. I‚Äôm sorry you can‚Äôt find it, I‚Äôd be so bummed. Regular sour cream isn‚Äôt even close.",2
"Oh man, if there‚Äôs any similarity between this stuff and the crema from Mexico (I haven‚Äôt been), I hear you. It‚Äôs totally ruined regular sour cream for me.",2
"8"" press, plenty good enough for corn tortillas.",2
"ü§§ü§§ü§§

Did you get the 8-in or 10-in?",2
Yes to both. I would even put ginger in as well.,2
I never thought about cinnamon. Cloves and bayleaf are a must for me however,2
"For starters, you could learn how to make some good Mexican rice and frijoles de la olla. Bonus points if you can make your tortillas (your local Mexican store may have tortilla presses for under $10) or find fresher ones at your local store (not Guerrero, calidad, etc). If you can find tomatillos, cilantro, and limes, the rest of the ingredients for a good salsa should hopefully be widely available (tomatoes, onions, fresh Serrano/jalape√±o/green chili, dried chilis, etc). Just add your protein of choice (potato/egg, calabasa, huitlacoche, etc.) and optional queso fresco/crema (or other cheese) and you can have easy tacos, quesadillas, or mulitas (remember to heat your tortillas to make them soft and flexible). Your rice, beans, and salsa (especially the beans) will last for days and you can prep the rest whenever you‚Äôre ready to eat. You can pickle some red onions with habaneros/hot peppers for a nice topping too. 

Also, for the rice, just keep trying different online recipes. Many use tomato paste, which I don‚Äôt particularly like (too intense of a tomato flavor). And don‚Äôt let bean recipes with pork or Manteca be a deterrent. They‚Äôll still be amazing and filling without pork! 

DISCLAIMER: I‚Äôm not Mexican, but I‚Äôve had my share of delicious food made in Mexican homes (although what I‚Äôm posting now maybe more resembles some food from a taco stand). I‚Äôve read some great suggestions here, and Mexican cuisine is so much more diverse than just tacos. I just wanted to add something easy to this list for getting started and for busy nights. Happy cooking!",2
"Dry toast them inna pan, but yes. Cinnamon at least, if you don‚Äôt like clove.",2
Yes but with a light touch.  The first time I made it the recipe called for too much and I had to doctor it with a bunch more spices and broth.,2
"We have an Uno Casa cast iron tortilla press - 8 Inch

Don't know about storing masa dough, but you can store the tortillas in baggie in fridge and reheat them before eating.",2
Man those little containers you're talking about reminds me of visiting Mexico. People here get mad when I tell them that the queso fresco and crema just aren't the same because they think I'm gate keeping but that stuff is delicious.,2
"That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm understanding.  It‚Äôs hard because from what I‚Äôve read a lot of the traditional recipes were just based on ‚Äúthis is just what grew here.‚Äù Now we seem to have access to different ingredients and so we may choose to use them.  

One thing I have noticed is that so much of the recipes in my books seem so similar in terms of the basic building blocks. What I mean is that they are  basically using masa in some form as the carb.  Whether I make it into sopes, or a tortilla, or I cook it more into a tostada, or stuff it into a tamale, it‚Äôs basically the same thing.  Then I add to it a protein, pork, chicken or beef, and then some veggies, peppers, tomatillo, tomato, etc.  add some beans and rice, and it‚Äôs a meal.  Those things all seem to come together in a bunch of different combinations, but they‚Äôre all so similar to me as an outsider with no knowledge at all.  It seemed rare to find dishes that had a completely different flavor profile.  Chiles en nogada is one, for example, that‚Äôs totally different, sweet and creamy...

When growing up in Mexico and living day to day life, did moms try and mix it up each night or did it seem relatively similar day to day?

One of the things I learned that was really cool is that different families would come together in a village and make large communal meals sometimes.   It said in my book, for example, that four moms might come together and spend hours on a day making huge pots of mole sauce and splitting it up among the families.  

As I said, I want to learn more and respect the culture.",2
"Context is important here. We Mexicans love our traditional food and for us is about our roots, ancestry and pride... it's our grandma making Tamales on a rancho stove, or our uncle making Carnitas for xmas, all eating it with our big family reunited.   

The US food industry has bastardized our food in undustrial levels, twisting it in a way that you can't recognize the actual recipes, to the point that the rest of the world thinks that Taco Bell is Mexican food. And that makes us Mexicans in actual Mexico very angry and forces us to gatekeep our culture and heritage. 

Just imagine for a moment that a huge corporation creates a ""jewish sandwich"" using hot dog buns, and pork meat drowned in Mayo, and in top of the insult people all over the world begins to know those as ""Kosher Burguers"". Let's say that you travel to Russia and people tells you ""oh i love those kosher pork buns that you people eat""  

So, regarding our cuisine, we would like people to know our actual recipes instead of ""reinterpreting"" them, wich is what everyone in the US seems to do before even try to cook the original recipe. It triggers us because of what american corporations have done to our beloved cuisine worldwide.",2
"Enchiladas verdes de queso. Green sauce over rolled tortillas with cheese inside. Chiles rellenos, peppers stuffed with cheese. I really enjoy sweet potato and white potato tacos and quesadillas.",2
"Easiest recipe ever.  It‚Äôs just masa, sugar, chicken broth and a little butter.  I made tortillas placed them on top of each other and rolled them into a tube and sliced.",2
"Chiles Rellenos (poblano peppers stuffed with melty cheese and battered).  They aren't particularly spicy, but the Mexicana sauce put on the outside can be.  Enchiladas rojas aren't usually spicy but can have a kick.  They're a rolled corn tortilla that's been heated in a chile sauce and briefly fried, filling is traditionally cheese.  For breakfast, chilaquiles are usually spicy, similar to an enchilada, only the tortillas are cut into squares and served in the chile broth.  Usually accompanied with eggs, rice and beans.    These are some of the basics to get you started.  Stay away from places with bright orange cheese.  If you see that, that's not a Mexican restaurant. Good luck!",2
"I‚Äôm going to make a small contribution compared to everyone else lol fried potato tacos (tacos durados de papa) and chile rellenos made with cheese. Also if you get the chance try agua frescas,they are drinks made from different fruits, rice, tamarind and Jamaica (hibiscus flower)",2
That looks very similar to my own Victoria press.,2
"Snacks: quesadillas, tlacoyos, sopes, gorditas, pambazos, flautas, tacos, they all can be meatless, there are tons of different toppings/fillings. Candy: tamarind tarugo (ball coated in sugar or chili powder), alegr√≠as, obleas rellenas (wafer with cajeta (thicker dulce de leche) and pumpkin seeds), jamoncillo (milk and sugar paste), ate (can be guava or membrillo). Drinks: horchata, charro negro or paloma (alchoholic).  Meals: chiles rellenos, calabacitas a la mexicana (vegetarian, super yum), pozole can be made vegetarian and is very flavourful, rajas con crema. There are also some vegan/vegetarian recipes for tamales made with soy protein mixed in the masa instead of lard.",2
can you refrigerate the massa after it's been made? how many days?,2
"Heyo! I stayed in US for abit and tried this Migas Poblanas Taco from Veracruz All Natural and it was my favourite taco AND its vegetarian. They have Egg, tortilla chips, poblano pepper, red onion, black beans, queso fresco, avocado (vegetarian).  


Now i know you are in canada but perhaps you can ask the mexican food stores if they have this taco? Fingers crossed. I stay in a country with 3 or 4 mexican places so if you can eat this that will be amazing :')

Website: [https://www.veracruzallnatural.com/east-austin/](https://www.veracruzallnatural.com/east-austin/)",2
"Amazing! I‚Äôm fascinated by those blue and yellow corn fritters, don‚Äôt suppose you have a recipe to share?",2
"I looked this up when I first discovered the stuff, it's got a higher fat content than sour cream but more importantly it's made with a different species of bacteria that gives it that cheesy flavor.  I now live in a place where I can't find it, and that makes me very sad.",2
Can you tell us what kind of press that is please?,2
"Your options may not be as limited as you think, a majority of traditional dishes can be made without meat since the most important thing in mexican food is corn, or harina de ma√≠z. I'm also vegetarian and my favourite meals are sopes and tlacoyos, they are usually served with salsa verde on top. I don't know how hard it might be to find good salsa verde over there, but we tend to have it with whatever we eat. You should also look for huitlacoche and flor de calabaza, which are great to make quesadillas. Chilaquiles are vegetarian as well and can be made with normal corn tortillas. I'm banking on you googling each of this meals but I have no problems looking for recipes if you want them. Enjoy your food.",2
"I used this [recipe](https://www.thekitchn.com/instant-pot-beef-birria-tacos-recipe-23105466#comments-23105466) using what I had on hand as this was a last minute meal. 

Instead the fresh tomatoes I used half a can of diced tomatoes. I don't have cumin seeds or black pepper corns so I just used the ground spice versions. 

I skipped the ginger. 

Also one big ""mistake"" but turned out to make it SUPER easy &amp; made for more consome (juice): I just added all of the ingredients that should go into the blender directly into the instant pot to boil with the chilis/garlic/onion.  I didn't realize you are supposed to only use two cups of that boiled water but I ended up dumping it all into the blender and the flavors are on point... And my family can never get enough consome- I can't imagine only using the 2 cups!

I've made birria many times &amp; this will be my go-to method from now on! Only 40min in the IP and about 20 min prep work!",2
They all look fantastic.,2
"Tacos look great, would love to see some pics of the press in action too",2
LMFAO he thought he did something,2
"Do it! My brother and I are already planning the next time we're going to make these as this was the first attempt and some mistakes were made.

I'm craving them all over again. Enjoy when you get them!",2
Thanks for the tip! I wonder if they used fresh guavas or the paste,2
Thanks,2
You're welcome.,2
Thanks.  I really appreciate it.,2
I think you should keep posting.,2
"Alright, there‚Äôs a local Mercado near me that started doing door dash to make some money. Going to have to throw them some cash for these tomorrow. I‚Äôm the only one in the house that will eat them, not worth making myself. These look tasty.",2
"I appreciate your well thought out response.  I think to some extent I get what you‚Äôre saying.   I wonder if the shoe were on the other foot, if I, as a New York Jewish boy, would be shocked to see a post of a kosher corned beef sandwich, on white bread instead of rye, with mayo instead of mustard, and served with Mac and Cheese instead of fries.  Yeah, I think I‚Äôd be shocked.  Would I make a snarky comment about it? Possibly.  Would I think it offensive to my culture? I guess.   Probably I would wonder not why someone chose to eat it that way, but maybe why someone would have so proudly posted it looking for acclaim.  

I guess as a newbie to the Mexican cuisine Im really trying to open up my years of cooking to this altogether new direction.  I‚Äôm doing that with the limitations of my own preferences.  For example I don‚Äôt eat beans.  I can‚Äôt pop spicy peppers like candy.  Some of the dishes I just adapt to what I like.  

I have made Chiles en Nogada and it was great.  I make my own tortillas from scratch, in both blue and corn.   I bake my own rolls and make my own carnitas from scratch.  I make my own tamales and definitely add my mole to it.  I‚Äôm getting there, but there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm going to become a Mexican mom, and that‚Äôs ok. 

You know what it is.  I suppose in my somewhat myopic world I think I‚Äôm doing a good thing.  I think that someone with a long history of Mexican cuisine should be thrilled to see this silly white boy ‚Äúhonoring‚Äù (in my mind) their heritage by trying to bring these dishes to a family that never had it before, rather than viewing it as bastardizing tradition.   Still, as I said, I might feel the same if one of my Mexican friends was serving my moms chopped liver on a torta.  

I suppose I get it more now, although I think the result is just me not posting thing  here anymore.  I mean I got all of it and as you can see I truly took it to heart.  I could have done without the snarky comment on my plates.  That‚Äôs the kind of thing that just feels so unwelcoming.  As I fell in love with the food and started to learn the culture, I bought a nice and very expensive set of talavera from Pueblo.  I don‚Äôt have a collection of fifty different ones accumulated over the generations.  I just have what I have, you know? 

Anyway.  Thanks again for the time it took to lag it all out.  It definitely gave me a different perspective and I think taught me an important point of view.",2

"You take it too hard, but don't take it to heart. I've been supportive, nice even. I think that where the consternation cones from is this:

You're posting mole. Cool. Lots of hard work. Lots of variation, too. You've discovered that part. But you're still presenting it in these weird bastardized ways. 

On top of saffron rice... Spanish, not Mexican. 
With jalape√±o poppers. Americanized bar food.
And corn ""fritters""... Texmex?

Now I get it. You just started having mexican food. So you don't know. I'm happy to forgive that ignorance, because it's not your fault you weren't exposed to the food when you were younger. It's not a bad thing. 

But... It does feel a bit disrespectful to the culture and the food (which was given a high, high recognition by UNESCO in 2010) to just sort of cobble it together without much regard for tradition. I'm not Mexican. But I've lived in Mexico and this cuisine is often regarded as sacrosanct. I respect that. Sure, I riff on classics and combine things that a traditionalist might not. I also have the base to know what's legit and what's simply an adulteration. 

Show me your cochinita pibil. Or your pipian. Show me a pescado zarandeado. Make a great tinga.  Take that delicious mole and make some tamales. Hell, make a batch of corn tortillas starting from nixtamal. Make chiles en nogada and make them delicious and beautiful. Challenge yourself to make it ""right"" and to appreciate the centuries of tradition that go into this cuisine. 

Or don't? I'm glad you got another plate. Also, you should check out r/Plating",2
Oh that's a great idea and it's about time my daughters help me out with some cooking here or there! Thanks!,2
Please keep them coming. Was hoping to find a Mexican publisher.,2

"Thanks.  You definitely have your work ahead of you.  

I really love to make different mole sauces and jar them in the fridge.  I can whip one up all day in my spare time and then just pull it out and make a mole pistachio chicken in under an hour",2
"Mmm that looks so good, especially the rice I love it, I'm going to steal it! 

going to *attempt* (emphasis on attempt) make this with my husband tonight, wish me luck haha",2
I will say it has gotten much better. The authenticity police don‚Äôt seem to come out as much. Or else they all realized that northern Mexico also has Mexican food.,2
Thanks!!  It was yummy.,2
It‚Äôs not just spelling. It‚Äôs people always looking at my dishes and saying it‚Äôs not ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù or it looks nothing like the version the it mother made.  It really makes people not want to share and that‚Äôs sad because sharing is what this is all about.  Just saying.,2

there is a region in aguascalientes that specializes in guava mole. calvillo is the place i'm talking about,2
"You could actually grind up some raisins if you have some on hand to help mimic this.  I've made the Serious Eats Carne Adovada recipe which does this, and it adds a certain depth of flavor to the dish.",2
/r/anchochile There you go op although I don't think that's what you are looking for.,2
It sounds like a manchamanteles mole. They're often made with whatever fruit is seasonal so you could absolutely use guava,2
"Alright, I don't usually do this, but I'm following this because that sounds amazing.",2
thanks!,2
I actually think a mix of those two would work pretty well. Ancho chile has a lot of dark raisiny dried fruit kind of flavors if that helps.,2
"Yes it will totally work. It will impart a bacon-y flavor, but if you like the taste of bacon in the first place then no reason to think you will find the tamales unpleasant.",2
I can't think of where I've seen them but mine is from Mexico. It was my abuelitas. I'm sure they are available somewhere here. We call it Olla de barro,2

"Honestly I eyeball everything. I would say equal amounts of all except the cumin, salt and cayenne. 
Cumin has a strong flavor and can over power, but you still need a good amount. Salt and cayenne are to taste.

"cook four chicken breasts or 6 deboned chicken legs in 2 quarts of chicken broth. If you don't have chicken broth, use the same amount of water. add an onion, lots of salt, some epazote, mexican oregano, 2 bay leaves and black pepper. Add 1 cube of chicken bouillon.

roast 4 tomatoes, 1 onion, 1 jalapeno and 4 garlic cloves.
destem and deseed 2 ancho chiles. toast them on the comal and let them soak in hot water for about 10 mins.

add the chile, the tomatoes, onion, jalapeno and garlic cloves to a blender and let it go brrrrrr.
take out the chicken, onion and bay leaves from the stock and add the blend. cook for another 20 minutes; season to taste.

pull or cut the chicken and add it to a bowl.
cut some tortillas, fry them until crispy. Don't forget to season with some salt when they come out of the oil.

ladle the soup over the chicken, finish with mexican crema, queso fresco, cubed avocado, the fried tortilla strips and cilantro.

Looks delicious! Where‚Äôd you find the huitlacoche?,2
Huitlacoche is bomb but what‚Äôs epazote?,2
This is one of those super easy yet impressive things any one can make. One of the first grown up meals I learned and I am NOT the best cook.,2
"Yeah I've had rolled tacos dorados with chorizo, chicken, beans etc. I've never had pupusas so idk I'll have to try it. I think I might try it's on the sweeter side and not too spicy. If I find it I'll let you know, I tried googling a bit already",2
Hmm. Please let me know if you find it,2
And I think I misunderstood you the salsa was not mixed with the taco or the crema/queso.,2
I don't think it was cooked it was still crunchy and it's tomatoes based and I think I remember cilantro. I'm gonna try and ask in the Mexico sub or the salsa sub,2
"But that also could be a torta de alambre. I had one like that and it was every single meat the place offered, plus beans, saut√©ed peppers and onions. Next best torta to the cubana",2
"See that makes more sense, and yeah, love sandwich cubanos, pork, ham, Swiss, mustard, pickle. Used to work at a Cuban restaurant",2
You could try cooking it in the oven next time. With just enough braiding liquid. You‚Äôll still have enough consom√© for each serving but hopefully not much leftover,2
"In M√©xico city and surrounding areas; torta cubana usually is made with all available ingredients (torta related) from the place you're having it. Usually is the biggest and most expensive thing from the torta section.

As far as I know, sandwich cubano is a roasted pork and mustard filled bun.",2
"Yeah that‚Äôs how I served it but as compared to the amount of tacos I make, I have so much more consomm√© left over in the end and that‚Äôs what I meant by seeming to have a lot more soup than meat",2
Maybe it varies. In my family Escabeche is a mix of things like ceviche.,2
"Really? That‚Äôs it. A quick Google search yields results more in line with what I said. One or two ingredients swapped or added. Chorizo in place of pork, avocado",2
Escabeche pork with avocado,2
Was the cabbage cooked or raw? I‚Äôm trying to find it online,2
"Yeah that‚Äôs what I meant in my comment. I usually make them with chicken or chorizo not picadillo. Idk, have you tried just making your own? Play around with the ingredients. It wasn‚Äôt similar to the repollo you get with pupusas?",2
Yes it's mixed together but like I said these weren't the regular rolled tacos dorados. They're folded in half and half two toothpicks holding the beef picadillo inside. Only ever had it at served at parties,2
Mexico The Beautiful Cookbook,2
"You need to serve the consom√© with the birria tho. That‚Äôs the proper way to eat it. Serve each guest their bowl with meat and broth, tortillas, onion, cilantro and lime on the side. They build their own tacos and either dip or spoon the consom√© as they please",2
"It might not have been a salsa with cabbage, it just looks like that in the taco. Whenever we make tacos dorados you make a salsa de √°rbol, put cabbage in the taco, queso fresco, crema. Was it mixed together?",2
How was the texture?,2

"Ingredients

‚Ä¢2 lbs. of ground beef

‚Ä¢2 tsp salt

‚Ä¢1 tbsp. all purpose seasoning

optional 

‚Ä¢jalapenos


Guacamole
‚Ä¢1-2 avocado

‚Ä¢1/4 cup red onion

‚Ä¢1/2 cup tomato

‚Ä¢1 jalapeno

‚Ä¢1/2 cup cilantro

‚Ä¢2 tbsp. lime juice

‚Ä¢salt to taste

‚Ä¢tortillas

‚Ä¢1/4 cup cheddar cheese

Directions
Season the ground beef with salt and all purpose seasoning. Mix together and form your burger patties. To a cold cast iron skillet place the hamburgers in to the skillet and cook over medium high heat for 4-5 mins flip and continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes. (Your cooking time may be shorter, mine took a bit longer due to the very large pan I was using that wasn't able to get enough heat coverage from the flame)

For the guacamole slice the avocado in half and remove the seed. Scoop out the inside of the avocado into a large bowl. Add in the chopped veggies red onions, tomato, jalapeno and cilantro. Add lime juice and salt to taste.

To make your burger place a low carb tortilla shell down in your skillet to heat for 30 sec - 1 min. Flip and add cheese, a spoonful of guacamole and top with the burger. Fold the edges in a circular pattern to close the quesadilla. Heat on both sides until the shell is crisp and brown 30 sec per side and enjoy. Cooking spray may help with browning shell.",2
"Considering what the world outwith Mexico considers ""Mexican Food"", some legalism is desired and needed at times IMO but no need for the nastiness that sometimes occurs as a result.

Looks amazing!,2
"Tamal comes from the nahu√°tl word Tamalli, so they are considered mostly Mexican. It's the most popular way to call them, but several versions have other names, even in Mexico. Other Central American and South American countries have similar recipes, and they also call them tamales. Other countries have their own version with similar ingredients or similar processes and different names.

"Definitely meat. Not to be confused with Zuman which is sweet rice dessert wrapped in banana leaves. My aunt is actually famous for her tamales in the Philippines. https://www.angsarap.net/2016/10/12/filipino-tamales-bubuto/ 

Philippines were raped by the Spaniards for 300 years. You‚Äôll definitely find lots of influences and over lapping in the cuisines.",2
Low and slow. Think of any meat tough meats. The longer you simmer it the better as it breaks down all that muscle tissue. I love lengua.  A shortcut would be using a pressure cooker,2

What chili‚Äôs do you use in the birria sauce?,2
I can definitely see the chix confit w mole sauce. I often see the no searing in mostly Asian and Latino cuisine. I‚Äôm trained in French classical and it‚Äôs different from everything I was thought. Hence my query. Thank you for the apt response.,2
"Thanks for the comments y'all! Like I said, she never measured how much she used, she just knew naturally, so I think her trying to measure it for a recipe is why it's off. What I'm going to do is at least 1 tsp. salt, keep the 1/4 tsp. baking powder or maybe even just take it out and I'm going to stick with oil and the only reason why is because I never buy lard, so if I can work around with oil, I'm going to try at least and see. Luckily to make tortillas is pretty cheap so even if I mess up, it's not too bad",2
"They would come out really smooth, soft, and fluffy every time. I was doing store bought for awhile but it's so hard to go back.",2
"&gt;some gringa cook puts chilli and doritos on a ""pozole"",

like the tex mex soup chilli? why would you do that?

&amp;#x200B;

I thought Rick Martinez was weird for using corn nuts (the snack food) as a topping because they are essentially air-fried nixtamalized kernels but it works because it's complimentary. 

&amp;#x200B;

Doritos, I can't imagine them doing anything except cheapening a wonderful bowl of soup... dont get me wrong doritos are great, in a bowl, in front of the television.",2
The rando guy that said that fruit doesn't belong to moles is probably having a seizure,2
"Searing meat for mole is something we commonly don't do, but you can do it anyways, although the crispness it can get will be gone once you let your meat cook in the mole. If it's for flavour purposes I believe you won't notice much of a change as mole tends to overcome the meat flavour. 

Some fancy restaurants make chicken or turkey in a kind of Pekin duck way, they cook the meat and then pour over oil on the skin to crisp it, then on the plate the mole is poured on the side without skin",2
Lmao the sauce on the other one looks like paper mache,2
"Blindado y apalabrado, looks yummy buen provecho!",2
Thanks! Look delicious,2
"We can agree on the fact that Mexican haute cuisine is virtually unknown in the US, compared with simple, fast food dishes like burritos. I'm with you 100% on that.

But if we list the 10 most popular Tex Mex dishes, we can find that any list is dominated by burritos, carne asada tacos, chimichangas, nachos, sopaipillas and the such. Tamales are cooked with the central/northern style and the version of Cochinita Pibil is the northern one, not the Yucatan Peninsula recipe. 

Feel free to correct me posting all those northern dishes you mention, i say this without sarcasm, it's the only way we can educate people here about what actual Mexican food is.",2
Doesn‚Äôt look good... yeah right. P√°same una tostada,2

"The secret for the color is, resting the fish on salt water the night before, it takes away that raw fish flavor and the color, alos it gives the meat a bouncy gummy consistency like octopus meat.",2
"Try the spray bottle trick. If the top side is literally wet, it can‚Äôt crack. The moisture cooks out immediately when you flip it. It won‚Äôt hurt the tortilla.",2
I love when the fish/shrimp doesn't look like ground beef. That's my biggest issue with Mexican ceviche. Looks delicious,2
"The burritos that you see in the US aren't the same as the burritos you see in states like Chihuahua, Zacatecas, Jalisco, or Baja California. The Northern Region hasn't that much of an impact on Mexican food in the US such as Jalisco. foods like pescado zarandeado, Caguamanta, jaiba a la frank, caldo de queso, tostadas de atun, Sinaloan style barbacoa  etc etc aren't as known compared to central and southern mexican dishes like Mole Poblano, lamb barbacoa, cochinita pibil, chile relleno, pozole and tamales.",2
"holy fuck that looks pretty terrible.

EDIT: The ones from VLA, not yours!

I have tried to recreate papadzules like I had them in Merida and Campeche, but I'm not getting it... Guess I'll leave it to the cooks of the yucatan peninsula.",2
Yes that‚Äôs exactly what I mean! What worries me is that I feel it could be all of those things,2
"When you say cracks, do you mean when you first put the raw tortilla down, the top uncooked side dries and cracks a bit like desert soil? This happens to me for several reasons: the dough is too dry, the dough is not ground finely enough, the heat is too low. The low heat may seem counterintuitive but what‚Äôs happening is that the low heat requires a longer cooking time, giving the moisture more time to evaporate. If you cook it at a higher temperature, then you can flip the tortilla in 30-60 seconds, allowing you to sear both sides of the tortillas before it cracks. Another option is to spray the uncooked top side of the tortilla immediately after placing the tortilla on the comal with water in a spray bottle. You can actually spray it quite generously. That will avoid the cracking.",2
"That's exactly the opposite of what i want. Because of geography, Northern Mexican food such as chimichangas and burritos are perceived as ""Mexican food"" as a whole, by Americans (and thus, the world). 

Central, Southern and South Eastern food is very under represented in the internet.",2

[https://ianboer.com.au/counter-top/crepe-maker/mr-waffles-crepe/](https://ianboer.com.au/counter-top/crepe-maker/mr-waffles-crepe/)

"Okay that's fair. But every Mexican menu I've ever seen (even at a legit Mexican restaurant) only ever lists ""Chile Relleno"". They're not always the same, but they're always similar and delicious. I'm sure there are regional variations but I'm pretty surprised at the level of demand for specificity. 

For comparison, I've spent A LOT of time in China. I can call anything ""Beef Noodles"" or ""Fried Rice"" and no one gets offended, but of course there's hundreds of different regional variations to these blanket terms. Me calling something a ""Chile Relleno"" should be the same sort of blanket term and should not offend anyone's sense of cultural significance.",2
"If you're referring to Mexican food, then generally when they speak of a chile relleno, they're talking about the dish with a chile poblano stuffed with meat or cheese and coated with either egg or some masa.

So while ""chile relleno"" does translate to stuffed pepper, one needs to take into account the cultural reference that they're speaking of.

For example it is like a Mexican going to Spain, asking for a tortilla, and be shocked that they're served an egg dish instead of a flat corn bread, or vice-versa.

So if you want to talk about other types of stuffed chiles then you just have to mention the type of chile for example jalape√±os rellenos, chile dulce rellenos &amp;c. since the default in Mexico will make people assume that particular dish.",2

"Thank you, they are chicken flautas, first i boiled the full chicken breast  with half an onion, cilantro, hierva buena and pepper, then left it to dry and chopped it to little pieces, the salsa has 4 green tomatoes, 4 jalape√±os, 1/3 onion, 3 garlic pieces, a bunch of cilantro, boiled it all with the chicken broth from before, you have to remember to remove the green tomatoes before they burst so they dont make the salsa too acid, if you dont want the salsa to be too spicy remove the seeds from the peppers but what's the fun in that, then added salt and pepper and blended it all, the guacamole is just 2 avocados mashed with little milk and sour cream, salt and pepper, i always add lime, it helps with avocado oxidation, and a little olive oil, then made the flautas with some tortillas i bought, filled the tortillas with chicken and kept them closed with toothpicks which yoy later remove, boiled some oil and submerged the flautas on it, cleaned them with a napkin to take off the excess oil later, choped some queso panela (don't know what it is on english) and some lettuce, put it all on the plate added some sour cream too.",2
"&gt;Cochinita Pibil

Sounds great! Do you eat this with flour or corn tortillas/tacos?",2
Carnitas would suit your needs! Or Cochinita Pibil if you have Achiote (annatto) over there,2
Well-done!,2
Rico!,2
These are so pretty! Love it!,2
"Wow the cheap mountain of shredded cheese really brings it together... 

And the dry looking tortilla on the counter...",2
If you don't give me the recipe I'm sending the cartel. /s ;),2
Recipe? These look perfect,2
"While I may be tempted to add ranch dressing on more than I should, it was sour creme mixed with lime juice.",2
Is that ranch on top?,2
Nice,2
Yum! Frijoladas are criminally under appreciated!,2
Oo what a fun idea. Hope it came out great!‚ù§,2
Un domingo de hacer una rica carnita asada,2
Looks fantastic! I'm sure he'll love it. Nice work,2
Hey I'll take that ü§£ü§£,2
Production stinks but your bad reaction to the candy was hilarious.,2
Looks fairly sensible to me. I was pleasantly surprised at the availability of product here.,2
This has got me missing my t√≠o‚Äôs carne asada! got my mouth watering OP,2
"This is just the dulce de leche from scratch and the cajeta. The second style is the sweetened condensed milk in a water bath in the oven... That's happening right now.

I'll never be able to live up to his grandma's dulce de leche not only because grandma, but also because she was a candy maker. So I've just decided to do my best.",2
Carne Asada they way I like it!,2
I think the food I ate was a bit different.  It was prepared in a kitchen by cooks wearing gloves.  Lol,2
Did the Mexican food looked like this: https://youtu.be/2Yz6TGWgclU,2
Hey man I know mexico is south of the US but no need to call names. ;-),2
Did they throw the ingredients? It's only real if they throw the ingredients. ;-),2
Home made for sure!  I‚Äôve been cooking since i was a little kid. My folks owned a restaurant.,2
Homemade or restaurant?,2
Hahaha you said cali. You‚Äôre definitely a transplant. Lots of things to try depending which part of California you live in.,2
Pretty?  I never even ate Mexican food until I moved to Cali last year.  Now I‚Äôm addicted.,2
What‚Äôs your address I‚Äôm Coming over,2
Looks great!,2
This is how they do the al pastor tacos in CDMX. The skill and dedication of these guys is one of the reasons why it's so hard to find good al pastor outside of Mexico.,2
These look so delicious! Do you strain the sauce at all? Or just blend it a long time?,2
Pineapple.,2
What he cutting off at the top?,2
"Oh my god thank you! I ate some of the best tacos in a taqueria in Condesa a few years ago but couldn't remember the name or exact location. I have thought about them often since.

This video brought back a flood of memories and some googling proved it was definitely a El Tizoncito! Thank you so much!",2
"Yeah regional for sure. But no matter what it‚Äôs called, I want to eat it.",2
You are welcome,2
You're welcome.,2
Thanks! I've had them before but never knew what they were called.,2
"Chiles G√ºeros, also known as banana peppers. They grill them and they are really good!",2
Made fish tacos with the ingredients that were available to me. After enjoying these I indulged myself with a glass of mezcal,2
"El tiz√≥ncito, delicious place",2
"Delicious. I like to ask them for the pastor to be put on plancha for a bit, I like it crispy and charred",2
"The tacos look good.

I love how people don't bite their tongues in this sub. Haha",2
"I'm guessing it's a regional thing. I thought burritos were small and fried. Then I found out they are these giant rolled tortillas things. And what I thought were burritos, were chimichangas. I've never seen flautas made with flour tortillas although I'm sure it's good.",2
My abuelita used to say it was cooked with love. That's why her's was so good.  I honestly think that's the magic. Love of the people you're cooking for - or the love of cooking and delicious food,2
huh?,2
I swear the abuelitas use magic in their food,2
Excuse me?,2
"I used one that I came up with myself.  I started by using the basic one from a restaurant in SLC called the Red Iguana and then adapted from that.   Basically a bunch of roasted pistachios, yellow peppers, tomatillo, onion, garlic, golden raisins, white chocolate, cinnamon, cloves etc.",2
You lost me at the sour cream,2
"Making tamales is easy. Making tamales where the masa comes out flavorful and firm but not dry, and the filling is spiced perfectly and the whole tamale melts in your mouth like butter... That takes a lot of work. I've made tamales with my abuelita and my mom and mine are still not as good as theres were. They're both gone now, so I guess I'll just keep buying some from the little old abuelitas near me ü§£",2
Wow! What recipe did you use?,2
I have always eaten limes with my tamales. Never seen pico and sour cream though. I guess some people prefer different things. But why would you so aggressive over something as simple as a tamale an internet stranger made?,2
"There are, at least, 4 chipotle varieties

Morita, mora, chipotle meco and rayado

You can use all of them the same way, there are slight variations in flavour and spicyness but that doesn't mean that one will be bad in certain preparations",2
/gatekeeping,2
I just fill the pan with a layer of oil and put the temp on medium high,2
What do you use to fry them? And how do you do it? I'd love to try this out!,2
I‚Äôll have to do some converting because America hates us too much to use metric but thank you very much,2
"And not even region always. In cdmx, it varies from restaurant to restaurant.",2
I wanna spank dat azz n eat mole with you,2
Get a couple chayote in there too,2
"Sin queso g√ºey, asco",2
Delicious!,2
"Pozole verde, migas de hueso (not the tex-me kind), caldo de oso, caldo de queso.",2
My mom use vegetable shortening and it works pretty well for her.,2
"Doesn't matter what you call them, they are all delicious.",2
These look delicious! They would actually be considered a tostada though.,2
"Some of my favs include sopa de lentejas, albondigas, garbanzo, queso con papa, and pozole.",2
"These look really well made! Perfect shape. 

I don‚Äôt trust them. Kidding. They look really neat like there a kids toy. Aesthetic. Feng shui.",2
"How funny! In Southern California I think most people think of taquitos as meat rolled in corn tortillas and fried, and then flautas as meat rolled in larger flour tortillas and fried.",2
Ahh got it. I think it will be very hard for me to find refined coconut oil because all the ones I seen say pure and organic and they just smell so bad like coconut to me,2
Refined coconut has no scent or flavor. It does however have the saturated fat content like lard (which is often used in tamales).,2
"Beef caldo. First time making it. 
Not as good as mom‚Äôs but taste good!",2
Since when do tamales come with limes? Y‚Äôall are out here fucking up Mexican food and it shows,2
Hi I notice you used coconut oil. Do they taste like coconut or smell like it. Because I also been looking for a vegetarian option but I hate coconut,2
"Thank you for the recipe.  

We‚Äôve only made these with a friends family for many years.  Been looking for a vegetarian version as we do not cook with lard.",2

# INGREDIENTS

[US Customary](https://brokebankvegan.com/how-to-make-tamales/#) \- [Metric](https://brokebankvegan.com/how-to-make-tamales/#)

#### Husks

* 1 package (\~25) corn husks ($1.60)

#### Dough

* 3 cups masa harina ($0.38)
* 2 tsp salt ($0.02)
* ¬Ω tbsp baking powder ($0.01)
* ¬Ω cup + 1 tbsp refined coconut oil ($1.26)
* 3 cups vegetable broth ($0.14)

#### Filling

* 2 cups filling of choice

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Corn husks

* First, remove the husks from their package and separate them. Sort through them and discard any husks that have holes or damage.
* Then, add the husks to your kitchen sink or a large bowl of hot water and soak for 30 minutes. This will make the husks more pliable and easier to work with during assembly. If they are extra dry, soak them for a few hours or overnight.

#### Dough

* To a large mixing bowl, add the masa harina, salt, and baking powder. Mix together using your hands or a whisk. Then, add the room temperature coconut oil and vegetable broth and mix with your hands.
* Continue mixing and kneading the dough until all the ingredients are well combined and the dough has a light, fluffy consistency (about 4-5 minutes).
* **Note:** the dough should not be very sticky. Use the ‚Äúpalm trick‚Äù (slap the dough with a clean hand and if lots of dough sticks to your palm, add more oil in 1-2 tbsp at a time).

#### Assembly

* Dry the husks off with a tea towel to remove excess water. Lay one flat on your counter, making sure the smooth side faces up and the wider end is closer to you.
* Scoop 2-3 tbsp of dough onto the middle of the husk. Spread the dough towards the wide end into a thin (¬º-inch thick) layer using a spatula, butter knife, or plaster knife. Top with 1-2 tbsp of filling (we used potatoes &amp; beans tossed in adobo sauce).
* Fold both sides of the husk towards the center to close the dough around the filling, then tuck one side of the husk underneath and fold the second side over top. Fold the bottom portion up and secure the tamal with a string of leftover husk. Continue this process until the rest of the dough, filling, and husks are gone.

#### Cooking

* Prepare your pot for steaming by adding 3 cups of warm water to the bottom. Then, place the steamer rack inside and cover it with a layer of extra corn husks.
* Begin leaning the tamales around the steamer in an upright position. Continue working inwards in a circular fashion until the pot is full.
* Cover the tamales with another layer of corn husks and a tea towel on top. Cover your pot with the lid, bring it to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and steam the tamales for 40-45 minutes.
* To check if they are fully cooked, remove 1 tamal at 40 minutes. Let it rest for 2-3 minutes, then attempt to open the husk. If the tamal separates from the husk easily, they are ready. If the dough still sticks to the husk, close it up and continue steaming for an additional 5-10 minutes.
* **Note:** make sure to keep a close eye on the water level of your pot during steaming. You don‚Äôt want to end up with a dry pot!
* When the tamales are finished cooking, remove them from the pot and let them rest for about 10 minutes to allow the dough to firm up. Serve the tamales while still warm on their own or with toppings. Enjoy!

### NOTES

* If your corn husks are quite large, you‚Äôll want to trim them to about 5 or 6‚Äù in diameter (this will ensure you don‚Äôt end up with massive tamales). Use the scraps for tying the other tamales and the extra-small husks for lining your pot.
* You can also use an electric mixer with a paddle attachment to make the dough, but we don‚Äôt find it necessary.
* Optional ingredients are not reflected in the price or calories of our recipes.
* We calculate nutritional information for our recipes with Cronometer
* Calories are only for a serving of the tamal dough itself. They do not include fillings.
* Recipe cost calculations are based on ingredients local to us and may vary from recipe-to-recipe.
* All prices are in USD.",2
Weird I usually think of taquitos as rolled with meat and fried while flautas are rolled with meat and cheese and then baked. Just goes to show you how region specific it is.,2
Bacon tacos are hella good! I like adding a fried egg with a nice runny yolk.... Now I want bacon tacos.,2
"\&gt;   but it was only after I got them that I found that it's chipotle morita that's typically used for chipotles adobados. 

As far as i understand, a Chipotle is just a smoked jalape√±o. So, you can totally use chipotles mecos to do your adobo, it will taste great, don't worry.",2
"I call those flautas. To me, taquitos are small tacos.",2
"In most Mexico, taquitos are any tacos with a small tortilla.",2
"No, it's cecina",2
Is that made out of bacon?,2
"The cobbed corn is always overcooked in soups. I'm picky about corn on the cob, must be crisp. 5 minutes cook time only, otherwise it's mushy.",2
"The ""-ito"" suffix is one of the many diminutives in spanish, so ""taquito"" literally means ""small taco"" and can also be used to refer to normal-sized tacos in an affectionate way. Many people use ""taquitos"" to refer to rolled tacos, but it varies depending on the region. For instance, where I live they're also known as ""tacos dorados"" or ""flautas"" if they're large.",2
Taquitos are usually rolled and fried,2
"They are so easy, its the first thing I think to make when I don't feel like cooking. Yours look pretty good. Changing it up with different salsas, pico de gallo or guacamole can make it seem like a different dish.",2
Lol cool. Thanks!,2
"Mini tacos, street tacos, taquitos. I think we all call them different ways. I called them taquitos cuz they're small!",2
"Those look delicious! Question: when I see this, I see a taco. You called them a taquitos, which I always thought were rolled tacos. Can you or someone clarify for me?",2
Pozole rojo is amazing,2
Thats how I always did it. I keep a little plate to the side and take the corn out let it cool and then eat it and slurp all the juicy broth. I also use the plate to put any bones from the meat after I eat it.,2
"Technically it's called ""lemon and herbs"" but my husband loves anything with lemon flavor lol",2
"For white corn I use about 10 to 12 grams of cal per 1 kg of corn and about 2.5 liter of water.

I leave it at medium heat for about 45 minutes and don't let it boil, if I see it starts to boil I lower the heat.

You can also check if your nixtamal is ready by grabbing 1 kernel and rub it between your fingers, if the skin peels easily I also try to cut it in half with my nail. If it cuts without much resistance then it's ready, after that I just let it rest overnight.

Next day I rinse the nejayote and peel half the corn, then grind",2
"Don't worry, I added salsa after!",2
"Generally how do you cook it when nixtamaling? I boil it for 25 minutes with 1 tbs per 8 cups of water, usually two or three cups corn",2
"Well all you need is tortillas and meat of choice some cilantro and salsa oh an cat forget about the cheese.
Looks good for your first time. Now I don‚Äôt see salsa on those tacos.",2
Thank you for this!!,2
Is it vegetable caldo or beef caldo?,2
"To check for water content in your masa make a small ball and press it lightly with your fingers, if it cracks it still lacks humidity. If it sticks to your hands you probably added too much. 

Also cracking happens if your nixtamal wasn't ready at the time you removed it from the heat or if you removed all the corn peel while washing it. But these are issues you learn to fix with time and depends on the type of corn you use, the amount of cal, the time left on the heat, the time left resting, if it boiled or was too cold...",2
"I‚Äôll experiment until I get those two right, thank you!",2
My wife make chile relleno soup which is quite good.,2
"I hear you, but that‚Äôs how it is lol I‚Äôve never questioned the corn being on the cob, but I just wait until the caldo is cooled down a little and not as full to start eating the corn. It‚Äôs messy but worth it.",2
"Your masa is either lacking of water or something went wrong with your nixtamal.

Also your griddle could be way too hot or too cold.",2
What is that yellow pepper called?,2
"I love sopa de lima, it's super simple and has a great flavor.  I recommend serving it with a garnish of sliced avocado and a tostada that has cheese melted on it and folded in half, forming a sort of crunchy little quesadilla.",2
Caldo de Res!,2
I was given [this](https://www.phaidon.com/store/food-cook/mexico-the-cookbook-9780714867526/) as a gift a few years ago and it has basically everything I could ever want.,2
I also suggest El Sabroso in Lakewood,2
"Mole de olla is a good dish for corn.

Roast a couple of dry chipotles and blend with tomato, onion and garlic. Mix with chicken broth and add green beans, carrots, corn, fava beans, zucchini.

Serve with a lemon wedge.

Pro tip: instead of chicken, try beef (cheap cuts) and add a couple of marrows.",2
Yeah that sounds right.,2
"Don't care for rice with flautas. Beans and salad, great salsa is the most important.",2
"  very cool, i‚Äôm also in pierce county so will have to check it out some time",2
"Cocido de res, San Crist√≥bal de las casas style: https://www.turimexico.com/receta-cocido-estilo-san-cristobal/

"That sounds delicious and as far as corn in soups, I mean most people pull it out and eat it with their hands.",2
No I nixtamalize my own corn and dough,2
Thank you!,2
This is advertising. Needs to be gone. I don't even post my blog posts there because I don't think we should do any self promotion. Vete a la chingada Luchito.,2
"Sopa de Lima is marvelous, if you can get proper mexican Lima.",2
"GREAT! I wish people here would get that less is more, as you clearly do.",2
"This sounds perfect for cold weather! This might be a dumb question, but how do you go about eating corn on the cob in soup? I just can't picture how it would work.",2
"&gt;this lady I know makes a soup in the style of fideo but uses vegetables instead of pasta

This is a great idea, and I have a spaghetti squash on hand right now. Thanks for sharing!",2
"Creamy salsa verde w/avocado
Guac and sour cream",2
"you gotta try the classic Caldo de Pollo. I make sure to do a whole frier and take off the skin, also add some chicken feet that will just add an awesome flavor.",2
It's about how you roll them and how you lay them in the pan. If you put the seam side down you dont need anything to hold them closed.,2
It is all about how you wrap them and lay them in the pan. Nothing else is needed,2
I was with you until the lemon pepper,2
Soft taco wraps? Wtf?,2
If they're store bought then they're old.,2
"Caldo de Cameron con chipotle, alb√≥ndigas, and this lady I know makes a soup in the style of fideo but uses vegetables instead of pasta like most Mexicans.",2

Your dough is dry. Add a little water and lower the heat.,2
That‚Äôs very insightful thank you.,2
"In Mexico it's just called corn flour. ""Masa Harina"" is a butchered English name for nixtamalized corn flour. Masa means dough and harina means flour, so ""masa harina"" doesn't make any sense.

You buy corn harina to make corn maza. Flour turns to dough.

Blue corn is my favorite and makes awesome tortillas!",2
"Cilantro is like a comfort food. I remember as a kid I would steal chunks my mom was chopping as she prepped dinner, and just eat small bunches. 

There's a lot of Mexican that don't use cilantro. Too many people just use it as decoration on this sub or they don't realize it doesn't belong on everything Mexican.",2
"Flautas, taco dorados, and taquitos are basically the same thing.  But taquitos are usually smaller tortillas, like the size used at the taco trucks.",2
"Saut√©ed up some carrots, onions, garlic, and zucchini.

Added the rice and toasted it a little.

Added some salsa I made and water.

Cooked rice like normal and let it steam. Added salt and lime juice.

Browned up some chicken cubes bien doraditos just in some butter. Added mole sauce and simmered on low for ~5min.

Tortilla.",2
So much easier.  I think of getting one sometimes but always wind up doing a five hour mile cook session.,2
*Tacos dorados,2
Looks good to me.,2
We also call these flautas.,2
"I use a metal skewer instead of toothpicks. I deep fry mine, so I drop in one skewer with five on there. It still works with the a shallow fry, just gotta make sure you space them a little.",2
Taquitos for sure at home and growing up in Northern California... but San Diego has me calling then rolled tacos these days.,2
Gotta remember to take the toothpicks out when you pull them out lol,2
How do you keep those rolled up when frying them? I tried using toothpicks but I've already eaten one and am scared to try again.. :(,2
Technically I think toquitos are corn and flautas are usually flour or vice versa but growing up we always called them flautas regardless tbh lpl,2
Taquitos were what I grew up with in border California.,2
What kind of sauce tho? That's key in my opinion!,2
This inspired a google search... Had to see if flautas could be made with corn because in CA flautas are usually made with flour tortillas. We call ones made with corn tortillas rolled tacos,2
I shallow fry mine seam side down in a cast iron skillet so I dont have to bother with toothpicks.,2
"I use toothpicks, and I pull them out as soon as they're out of the pan so they're still a little soft and easier to remove",2
Do you do anything special to keep them closed when you get? My MIL uses toothpicks but they are hard to get out once the flautas as are cooked.,2

"Here the recipe for my chicken panuchos

Panuchos recipe

Ingredients:

* Tortilla base  

   * around 2 cups of water
   * tortilla press machine
   * Salt
   * two cups masa harina (maseca)
   * 1/4 flour
   * 25 oz vegetable oil
* Toppings  

   * refried beans
   * 1 chicken breast
   * 3 tomatoes
   * 1 red onion
   * 2 yellow onion
   * Sour cream, media crema or crema salvadore√±a

   * black pepper
   * salt
* Preparation

**For the tortilla**: In a bowl mix, the dough and flour add water until you have a good consistency. add salt to your taste. let the mix rest for about half an hour. Make small balls and use the tortilla press machine to make the tortillas. In a large pan put enough oil to cover the tortilla and make sure is very hot before putting the tortillas in, once is very hot use a spoon to throw hot oil on top of the tortilla after a minute, or when the tortilla is looking golden flip it over and do the same on the other side for about another minute, put the tortillas in a metal strainer to drain the extra oil.

**For the red onion:** finely chopped the red onion in thin strips, in a deep pan pour about 3/4 gal water and let it boil then add the red onions, turn the fire off and let it rest for about 5 min. Drain the water and let it cold.

**For the cabbage:** finely chopped the cabbage and 2/3 yellow onions, put them on a bowl, and add the vinegar with salt, and massage with your hands. let it rest for about 15 min.

**For the chicken breast:** in a large pot cover the chicken breast with water, add 1/4 of yellow onion, and let it boil until the meat is soft (about 20 min). stir the water and shred the meat. In a different pan use some oil to cover the base and add 2/3 of a diced yellow onion and two diced tomatoes let them fry until soft, add crushed black pepper and salt then add the shredded chicken breast. let it cook for about 15 min.

**For the tomato salsa:** in a griddle put 12 tomatoes, 2 habaneros, two garlic cloves, 1/3 yellow onion. move them once in a while to make sure they don't burn. grab a blender and put the garlic, habanero, onions, and at last the tomatoes. add black pepper and salt to your taste and blend them well.

**Panucho integration**

Grab a tortilla smear some black beans, add chicken breast, cabbage, red onions, a slice of tomato, a slice of avocado, a line of cream, and cotija cheese.

Serve with tomato salsa on the side and enjoy it.",2

Looks fantastic,2
i wish i could find quesillo like in mexico. fresh it definetly has a more tart taste. at least in my are i can find almost anything except that. have to settle for regular fud stuff.,2
i would def say onion is in many soups though at least as a garnish. obviously not like sopa de fideo but any meat soup people love with onions.,2
Love them onions I see,2
Interesting. Thanks for commenting.,2

"Thank you. So I can actually just use blue corn flour, add water to make the dough, and cook it as tortilla?",2
Your tortilla will be blue. Depending on your plates it can actually accentuate the dish you‚Äôre plating. I say play around with it,2
"Same thing, blue corn flour comes from... blue corn. Not sure if your tortillas are going to be blue, but in some places in Mexico you can find blue tortillas.",2
"My spouse made them from a family recipe, I don‚Äôt have an exact recipe it‚Äôs just something he learned growing up. Here‚Äôs the basics of it though:

The sauce has tomatoes and dried √°rbol, guajillo and coste√±a chiles, and cumin. There may be onion or garlic too, I‚Äôll see if I can get more info...tomatoes and dried chiles get cooked in water just brought up to a boil then turned off to sort of steep. Then blended and cooked in a pan to reduce a bit and bring the flavors together. 

The filling is chicken poached with onion and bay leaves then shredded. 

Fresh corn tortillas go in the sauce and filled with the chicken, topped with more sauce then topped with lettuce, onion, radishes, sour cream and cotija.",2
"I was only kidding, you best believe if that was in front me it wouldn‚Äôt be once you blinked.",2
"Haha, the toppings are a bit intense but it‚Äôs a deep bowl/plate thing, I promise there were plenty of enchiladas hiding underneath.",2

### INGREDIENTS

[***US Customary***](https://brokebankvegan.com/how-to-make-horchata/#) \- [*Metric*](https://brokebankvegan.com/how-to-make-horchata/#)

* 1 ¬Ω cups long-grain white rice ($0.20)
* 2 whole cinnamon sticks ($0.10)
* 6 cups water, divided ($0.01)
* 3 cups unsweetened almond milk ($1.28)
* 3-4 tbsp cane sugar ($0.01)
* 1 ¬Ω tsp vanilla extract ($0.17)

#### Optional

* ¬Ω tsp ground cinnamon

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Rice

* First, wash and drain your rice. Add it to a large bowl with the cinnamon sticks and 4 cups of boiling water. Let the water cool to room temperature, then cover the bowl and transfer it to your fridge for at least 5-6 hours, but preferably overnight.

#### Almond Milk

* Add your almond milk and cane sugar to a small saucepan. Bring it to a low boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced by about half. Let it cool, then cover and store it in your fridge until you are ready to use it.

#### Blend &amp; Strain

* When the rice is ready, remove both cinnamon sticks. Add the rice and water to your blender and mix on medium until smooth, about 3-5 minutes. You may have to blend in 2 separate batches depending on the size of your blender.
* **Note:** you have a few options for blending the cinnamon. You can blend the whole cinnamon sticks with the rice and strain the pieces out, add in ¬Ω tsp of powdered cinnamon, or leave both out. It all depends on your personal preference!
* Once smooth, pour the rice mixture in batches through a very fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth into a large bowl. Squeeze or press down with a spoon to pass as much liquid through as you can.
* Pour it through the strainer or cheesecloth at least once or twice more (to catch any extra grainy bits). Continue this process until all the rice water has been transferred to your bowl.

#### Serve

* Mix in the rest of the water, reduced almond milk, and vanilla. Taste and adjust the sweetener if you want. If you prefer a thinner consistency, add in more water. If you prefer it creamier, add in fresh almond milk.
* Transfer to a large jar or pitcher for storage. Serve your horchata chilled on ice with a sprinkle of cinnamon on top. Enjoy!

### NOTES

* The sweetness level is very personal. If you prefer no sugar, try replacing it with stevia or leaving it out altogether.
* We recommend prepping the almond milk reduction the night before to let it cool and thicken in your fridge overnight.
* Optional ingredients are not reflected in the price or calories of our recipes.
* We calculate nutritional information for our recipes with Cronometer.
* Recipe cost calculations are based on ingredients local to us and may vary from recipe-to-recipe.

Cabeza is good because the meat moves a lot (this is why brisket and chuck make great burgers) and it is just meat that grows on the head. Lengua is the same way. Muscle is muscle and once the outer membrane is off it is beautifully tender and delicious. 

Some of the most delicious meat on a cow comes from the shanks, the oxtail, the head and right next to the organs (suadero). Time to get out of your head and eat from nose to tail. Try some tripitas.",2
I think Sabina is a bit more? Honestly I wasn't price sensitive at all there and just ordered everything I wanted. My wife and I plan on going for a weekend and that restaurant plays a heavy role in our desire to return.  The urchin was sublime. The only other thing I had on our road trip from Phoenix to Cabo that was as memorable was a c√≥ctel of blood clams.,2

HELL, we injected bleu cheese mold into wheels of chihuahua and aged it at my father in laws place, tried making chihuahua with trompillo the old school way, too. Once a good foundation is set, you can do a lot. I'll take pasilla, rehydrate it, get any of the papery skin off and stuff with a chorizo and potato and then do the capeado or ripen poblanos to red and stuff with marlin and shrimp, serving it soaked  in escabeche because I saw it like that in Mazatlan once. Sorry. I haven't eaten for 19 hours.",2
"I didn't see anything in your post I disagree with, i don't think. There's a zone i think this sub ought to live in where it accepts people's riffs and adaptations, but can also serve as a place of education. If someone labels adobada al pastor, it should get called out because al pastor has a standard for naming. 

A lot of people's only experiences with mexican food, as varied and delicious as it is, have been at drive thru americanized spots, restaurants that serve everything with red rice and cheddar covered refried beans, and taquerias with 200 item menus that might do three things well. Others on here look at mexican food through the lens of what they ate as a kid in their mom's kitchen and take it as gospel. 

People who don't have a nuanced view of the cuisine need to be willing to understand that their experience doesn't mean menudo can't be green or white. I've run into that in the real world and online alike. 

Can a hot dog or sushi be Mexican? Hell yeah. 

Does soy sauce get used in mexican cuisine? Sometimes!

Is it carne asada if you deep fry it or bake it? No, not really.

I hope people will have some respect for the culture, stop the myopic ""pues en mi pueblo as√≠ no es"" stuff, and value epistemology when sourcing their recipes.",2
Are the prices the same in the restaurant compared to the street cart?,2
It‚Äôs Ranchera(I think it maybe Arrachera some places). It‚Äôs like skirt steak I think. Home made tomatillo salsa(everything grown at home).,2
Solid. Type of meat?,2
My boyfriends family is from Michoac√°n as well and I love cooking for him! He‚Äôs open to trying a lot of different Hispanic food so I also take notes from my Puerto Rican friend. Something simple you can make that is refreshing is Horchata! There can be many varieties but it is a sweet rice water and cinnamon drink,2
"&gt;Frankly, you'll be better off with a pulled mozzarella or a muenster that is whole milk than a ""Oaxaca"" that is made from skim milk. 

I find Muenster has the slight lactic tang that asadero has, even the highest quality mozzarella doesn't. A well made Monterey Jack (not a standard grocery store brick type) cheese works also.",2
Make a tortilla press with wood.,2
No te rajes.,2
"For your cheese, just look for it to be whole milk. Hell, you could pull it yourself.  Frankly, you'll be better off with a pulled mozzarella or a muenster that is whole milk than a ""Oaxaca"" that is made from skim milk. More butter fat, melts nicer... Calling a cheese ""Oaxaca""  and pulling it to get fibers doesn't rule out adjuncts or make it more authentic.  Unfortunately a lot of products aimed at the Mexican market in the US compete on price but not quality  Now, that is just my opinion BUT... I married a cheese maker's daughter and interned for my suegro in Mexico, so take that for what it's worth. 

For the capeado, I've never put the flour in the capeado, only used it to dredge the chile to ensure it adheres.  I lightly salt the yolks before folding into the whites. 

My thought on the salsa is that if you put something with jalape√±o, serrano, g√ºero etc in it on a Chile relleno you're going to lose a bit of the subtlety of the flavor of the poblano. A traditional salsa for rellenos is huaje tomato (roma, basically), boiled with white onion slices (latitudinal) blended without the onion and passed through a fine mesh sieve, then combined with the onion and mexican oregano, lightly salted.",2
a good taco is more than just the sum of its part.,2
"No... No they don't. Or... We don't. Longaniza and chorizo are different. The way a bockwurst and knockwurst and a vienna sausage are different. The way tequila and pulque are different. 

Most typically, chorizo is cooked out of its casing, while longaniza is cooked IN the casing. Mexican chorizo doesn't usually form the protein bonds that hold it all together like many other sausages, mostly because of the presence of more vinegar in it. 

They're cousins, but one isn't called the other. As for your assertion, Toluca us known for GREAT chorizo, and for GREEN chorizo, but it's not THE *authentic* chorizo.",2

"Roasted poblano? ‚úîÔ∏è

Cheese?: I usually use Oaxaca (never cheddar).  Where we live it's a luxury to be able to get oaxaca, cotija, and queso fresco.

Capeado?: The recipe I have calls for 2/3 C. of flour.  Is the flour something I should leave out?

Thank you x100 for the tip about how you handle the capeado.  That's genius!  Do you let it cook for a few seconds before pressing the pepper into the batter to envelop it?

Salsa?:  I make a ranchero sauce from scratch.  It's pretty tasty and I'll put that on everything ü§§",2
Este g√ºey si sabe. Que le hagan caso.,2
"So... Try simple first. 

Important elements: roast the chile but just enough to get the skin off and the seeds out.

Filling: good cheese. Not part skim. Real whole milk asadero or chihuahua. NOT cheddar.

Alternatively, a old school picadillo with raisins, nuts, etc. 

The capeado... separate your whites and yolks, beat the whites to stuff peaks and then fold in the yolks. 

My experience is that dipping is a rookie mistake. I add the capeado to the (large) oiled skillet, place the dredged chile relleno on it, then fold it over, they come out beautiful this way. 

Salsa: a very simple tomato, onion and mexican oregano salsa should do the trick. 

If each component comes from good ingredients handled with care, they should turn out delicious.",2

Its purpose is just to up the heat slightly; most of the chile flavor comes from the ancho and guajillo.

"Hello mate, I'm from M√©xico City, there is a lot of recipes, it depends on who you ask, but this is my recipe for the birria with beef (But you can use sheep meat)

Ingredients:
1.6 pounds of breast, 1.6 pounds of loaded ribs and 3 bone marrows
8 chiles guajillo 
8 chiles anchos 
4-5 bay leaves
4 pieces of garlic
1 cinnamon branch
Salt, pepper, cumin (1/2 tbsp) y dry cilantro (1 tbsp) 
2 cloves
5-6 tomatoes
1 onion

Procedure:

Cut the tomatoes and onion in 4 pieces and cook them until they turn soft
Add the chiles (without the root) and garlic, cook them with the tomatoes and onion
Add 1 1/2 cups of water and the cinnamon branch, let it boil for 5 minutes

Put in a blender salt, pepper, cumin, cilantro, cloves and the mixture (with water), blend for about 3 minutes or until well ground.

Put the meat, bone marrows and the blended product in a pressure cooker, add water until the meat is covered. 

Put it on a high heat and until the pressure starts to escape, you count 25 minutes and then turn off.

Your birria is ready to eat c:

Eat the tacos with coriander, onion and lemons, they give a lot of flavor and texture. 

One recommendation is to marinate the meat a day earlier in the same mixture, it will give you much more flavor

*\*local ingredients purchased the day of cooking so prices may vary*

### INGREDIENTS

[***US Customary***](https://brokebankvegan.com/sweet-potato-black-bean-quesadillas/#) \- [*Metric*](https://brokebankvegan.com/sweet-potato-black-bean-quesadillas/#)

* 12-14 [***corn tortillas***](https://brokebankvegan.com/how-to-make-corn-tortillas/) ($0.26)
* 3 small sweet potatoes, baked or steamed ($1.47)
* 1 ¬º cups [***cooked black beans***](https://brokebankvegan.com/how-to-cook-black-beans/) ($0.48)
* 1 tsp garlic powder ($0.01)
* Salt to taste ($0.02)
* 6 oz vegan mozzarella, shredded ($1.87)

#### To serve optional

* [***Guacamole***](https://brokebankvegan.com/guacamole-and-tortilla-chips/)
* [***Salsa fresca***](https://brokebankvegan.com/homemade-salsa-fresca/)
* [***Mexican crema***](https://brokebankvegan.com/vegan-mexican-crema/)

### INSTRUCTIONS 

#### Tortillas

* To begin, [***prep the corn tortillas***](https://brokebankvegan.com/how-to-make-corn-tortillas/) by mixing masa harina with water and salt. Knead until you have a ball of dough, then pinch off small pieces (about the size of a golf ball). Cover the dough balls with a tea towel until you prepare the rest of the ingredients.

#### Filling

* Remove the sweet potato skins and add the orange flesh to a mixing bowl. Add garlic powder and salt to taste, then mash together with a fork. Once the sweet potato is mashed to your preference, mix in the [***cooked black beans***](https://brokebankvegan.com/how-to-cook-black-beans/). Set aside.

#### Cooking

* Make sure the cheese is shredded, then preheat a cast-iron skillet up to medium. To make the quesadillas, press each ball of dough with a tortilla press or roll it out until quite thin. Add this into the skillet and cook for 30-40 seconds on the first side.
* Flip the tortilla, then add a handful of grated vegan mozzarella and a spoonful of the sweet potato and black bean mixture to one half of the tortilla. Fold the other half over to make a half-moon shape.
* Cook on both sides until the cheese is melted and the outsides are crispy with brown spots. Continue this process until there is no more sweet potato and bean mixture or cheese left.
* **Note:** these quesadillas can be made with [***flour***](https://brokebankvegan.com/how-to-make-flour-tortillas/) or store-bought corn tortillas if you're short on time. Follow the same cooking steps as above, although we don't recommend folding store-bought corn tortillas since they are more likely to crack.
* To avoid cracks, spread the cheese and filling across the whole tortilla in the skillet and place a completely new one on top before flipping.
* Serve your quesadillas warm with a side of [***guacamole***](https://brokebankvegan.com/guacamole-and-tortilla-chips/), [***salsa fresca***](https://brokebankvegan.com/homemade-salsa-fresca/), or [***Mexican crema***](https://brokebankvegan.com/vegan-mexican-crema/).

"Chile, tomate, cebolla! Siempre gana La Porra! (Went to Glady's Porter HS, and this was our fight song!)",2
"Cumin/Comino is used in stews chiefly alongside other warming spices. I've typically only seen it used in caldos, moles, and birria. California style carne asada likely has it as a prevalent flavor in most ""tex mex"" dishes and the combination of cumin and mexican oregano is the main ""taco flavor"" of store bought American ground beef taco meal kits like Taco Bell and Old El Paso. It's also the flavor that makes chili taste like chili.

"The basics I use always seem to include tomato, onion, garlic, Mexican oregano, jalapeno, Chile Ancho, Chile Guajillo, Chile Pasilla, cilantro, avocado, pinto beans, rice. And if I'm cutting corners, chicken bullion cubes or powder from one of the popular brands.",2
I don't think I've ever used cumin in anything Mexican I've ever made.  What do you use it in?,2
"Tomato, onion, basil leaves, coriander (cilantro), garlic, chile verde/fresco (a wide variety: bell peppers, jalape√±o, serrano, chulada, habanero, poblano, etc.), chile seco (guajillo, pasilla, cascabel, ancho, chipotle, etc.), or√©gano, romero, ma√≠z, frijol, arroz, calabaza (a wide diversity: chilacayota, italiana/zucchini, criolla/verde, etc), semilla de calabaza, carnes variadas (pollo, cerdo, res)

I do the cooking at home most of the time. That's what I use more often.",2
"A little spicy, but don't think it was as much as habanero",2
"Onion, garlic.",2
"Tomatos, tomatillos, serrano peppers, onions, beans 

Theae are foundation in all Mexico",2
"For chiles I would say guajillos, anchos, de arbols, and chipotles in your pantry.  Jalapenos in your fridge always, and serranos or habaneros if you like more heat with poblanos for certain dishes.  Keep roasted Hatch green chiles in your freezer if you like New Mexican style dishes, they're only in season in August and September.",2
"I‚Äôd say beans may be even more ubiquitous than corn. Some regions of the north, for instance grow wheat rather than corn, but beans of some kind are absolutely everywhere.",2
My house keeper is el Salvadoran. She made this for us and we were blown away. It‚Äôs absolutely fantastic. I‚Äôve never enjoyed yuca more.,2
"Nixtamalized corn is the absolute basis. Add nopales, chocolate, oregano, tomato, garlic, beans, meats and a fuckton of chilis, and you have most of the main ingredients for mexican food.",2

This has been my favorite recipe I've found so far: https://tastykitchen.com/recipes/breads/sonoran-flour-tortillas/

I've also started mixing the lard into the warm water, rather than mixing the lard in until ""wet sand state"" and then adding the water. I just add the lard/water mixture to the flour/salt and mix. It seems to make them a bit more chewy, if that's what you like.",2

"Disrespectful? The only disrespectful thing in this conversation is the utter ignorance you show of Mexican cuisine. The first comment I made was talking about manchamanteles, a traditional MOLE from Puebla and Jalisco that dates back to the XIX century. I always try my best to teach people of different Mexican dishes outside the common and popular stuff, but the fact that you think adding fruit to a mole is disrespectful really rustles my jimmies. 

I really hope you learn more about Mexican cuisine and its variations before claiming such thing, because if you think adding fruit to a mole is disrespectful and ridiculous, I don't even want to know your opinion after I tell you that ladies that have the title of ""cocineras tradicionales"" add Marias crackers and animal crackers to moles.

I won't even answer you anymore than this, so have a nice life",2
Fair point. I was just trying to provide some other views.,2
"This is basically a thin atole soup, the main process is making a ""tea"" with epazote and chayotes, then adding the masa to make the atole and then adding the main perfume which is the avocado leaves, that if you're using fresh, when you pass them through fire it helps them to release its perfume.

The texture is slightly thick but not as thick as a regular atole de masa, so even though it has body its not a heavy soup at all!",2

There's a complete difference in fruits like Chile,tomatoes, etc. When you mention fruits like banana and pineapple being used in mole it starts to get very ridiculous &amp; ultimately kinda disrespectful.

"I'm sorry I keep forgetting to add the recipes:

3 chayotes, cut into cubes, if they're kinda old you can peel them. Also peel them if they have thorns, you don't want to eat that

1 handful of fresh epazote

2 avocado leaves, preferably fresh

1 fistful of masa, I used blue corn nixtamal I made yesterday, hence the beautiful colour but you can use any masa you have at hand

3 liters of water

Dried chilies or fresh piqu√≠n

Salt

In a large pot add the chopped chayotes, the epazote and water and simmer at medium heat until the chayotes soften slightly. Remove the chayotes and leave the epazote, let it simmer for another 5 minutes and then remove the epazote.

Make a slurry with the masa and some water, either by hand or in the blender, then add the slurry to the soup sieving it. Move constantly until it starts to thicken, then add salt and keep stirring.

Char slightly the avocado leaves in direct fire if they're fresh, if they're dried just add directly to your soup. Let it cook for 5 minutes, then add the chayotes back and let it in low heat from 5 to 10 minutes. Serve and add the chilies to taste.",2

"# Ingredients

* 16oz (1/2kg) dried black beans
* 1 large yellow onion
* 1 head garlic
* 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil
* 2 teaspoons (10ml) salt
* 2 bay leaves

# Directions

1. Rinse the black beans in a bowl of cold water to remove any dirt and also check for rocks.
2. Add beans along with 8 cups (2L) water to a slow cooker.
3. Remove any excess paper from the outside of the garlic then cut in half and add to the slow cooker along with 2 bay leaves.
4. Set the slow cooker to low and cook for 8 hours.
5. Once the beans are done cooking, discard the garlic and the bay leaves.
6. Use a ladle to transfer all the beans and some of the broth into a blender. The broth should be level with the amount of beans, no more or it will be very watery.
7. Blend on high until completely smooth and set aside.
8. Chop the onion very finely and saut√© in olive oil in you largest skillet until the onions are a deep brown color.
9. Add the beans along with the salt and cook on medium high until desired consistency is reached. You'll need to continuously stir (preferably with a wooden spoon) for approximately 15 minutes for them to become thick.

You can have your own preferences, but there's no way a consensus on which state has the best food can be made",2
"You could make something authentic to your family, that would probably be cool too.",2
Oooh that's a good idea!! Thanks,2
Something like[this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HxKOpLC5ces),2

Would you mix it in with the pork or just add it when eating it?,2
You don‚Äôt really need soda it‚Äôs kind of an optional ingredient.,2
"Hell
Ya. I love it...what‚Äôs Molotes?",2
"Guess I'm not part of my own culture, sorry for appropriating.",2
"It‚Äôs close enough, I imagine it‚Äôs not easy to get real authentic Mexican food where they are. I bet they‚Äôd say the same about our Chinese food.",2

"A good salsa, and pico de gallo could work in a pinch",2
"...lol, raised in South Texas, this is ‚Äòabove‚Äô my pallet",2
"this guy is always on about 'you dont know Mexican food', you don't know how to come at a community humbly presenting yourself as an equal. act like you're on a higher ground with titles like that all the time. get off it",2
I‚Äôm from Northwestern Mexico and I never heard of this.,2
I had never heard of them either!,2
This should keep me occupied for a while. Thanks!,2

Yes,2
"It is a great point in favor, I had not seen it like that, thanks!",2
Looks delicious. Not sure we can make blanket statements about very regional food within Mexico though.,2
"If you are practicing plating techniques, something is to make sure your herbs aren‚Äôt so sad looking. And instead of laying it flat use the point of connection to stand it up, therefore adding verticality.",2
Oh thats perfect! Thank you! I'll let my friend know she mighr finally get to try these lol,2
"From wikipedia: ""A¬†molote¬†is a filled, corn-based pastry usually served as an appetizer or snack in Mexican cuisine. It consists of a dough made from corn¬†masa, sometimes blended with mashed potatoes, that is filled with various ingredients, then fried in lard or oil. In some areas molotes are rolled into cigar shapes or ovals, in others they are formed into half moons similar to¬†empanadas.""

Did you add ""central"" (in ""central mexican cuisine"") or has the entry changed?",2
"I live in Austin, TX",2
A salad,2
This sub has a post like this every week it seems.,2

Sorry but mexican food and healthy just don't go together,2
That's cool! But I meant which state or city? So we keep it in mind for our next food travel! Lol,2
Ceviche tostada,2
There‚Äôs too many rules with this food,2
What am I???,2
This is an R&amp;D dish we are working in at the restaurant I work at,2
"Looks delicious, like a Mexican samosa.",2
"From Guerrero , tierra Caliente born and raised. Guess I'm not Mexican",2
r/gatekeeping,2
"With very little modification using pork (and more chiles, less garlic/onion) you'd essentially have chilorio, a dish from Sinaloa, if you continued to simmer the pork in the chili paste until there is almost no moisture left. Because of the acidity of the chiles and the lack of water moisture, this dish apparently keeps at room temperature for days and refrigerated, weeks.",2
"Access to ingredients is interesting. I live in a Mexican neighborhood now and three of my grocery stores have pretty good selections. Pepper and chile varieties, queso Oaxaca and cotija, things like cactus and yucca, etc. 

I‚Äôm able to replicate the stuff I‚Äôve had pretty well. It just seems like it‚Äôs not uncommon to order Mexican food in all kinds of neighborhoods in NYC and be given a flavorless plate of overcooked meat, dry rice and beans, and lettuce covered in crema. Which is so weird to me, since these restaurants are literally being run by Mexican immigrants or first gen families. 

Obviously it isn‚Äôt a rule. I‚Äôve had some amazing meals all over the city. I think it must have something to do with dumbing down recipes and stuff for Americans.",2
"definitely depends on the age of the bird too. In the USA most of your grocery store rotisserie chickens are fryer birds which are only 3mos old and less than 1kg/2lbs including skin and bones and I can eat one by itself for my own dinner if I'm hungry enough. Growing up on a farm we didn't kill chickens to eat unless they stopped producing eggs so we would have a 3kg/6lb hen that was 2-3 years old about once a month and in a stew, would feed my fairly large family at the time.

All of the chicken I've had in Mexico tasted like the chicken I grew up eating on a farm. Same with the beef, truly grassfed beef is a little tougher and has a gamier flavor than CAFO corn-fed beef, but that's the way beef is \*supposed\* to taste anyway.",2
"Ironically, my girlfriend cooked this for me last week and it was fantastic! She did pork with her chili paste and she served it with beans, sliced potatos, and tortillas. I ate leftovers for a few days üòãüòÅ",2
"Trying to compare any region with the style of some other region is not very smart, since Mexico being the land of so many cultures, not only national, but also foreign by settlements established in times of conquest, it is home to an astonishing mix of techniques, Puebla is recognized for its conventual food that was established by the nuns of the religious convents established by Europe since when arriving by the Atlantic and disembarking on the shores of the Mexican Caribbean and Gulf was one of the first settlements where a native and european fusion proliferated.",2
Guess I don‚Äôt know Mexican food :/,2
"The difference in taste and texture of meats is very different between the countries. Even something like a ham and cheese sandwich tastes different. I've even heard of people trying to smuggle in Mexican bologna into the States to resell.  I must say though that here in the USA a family of four might be good with one chicken for dinner, but that same family might need 2 chickens in Mexico because they tend to be smaller. Quantity over quality I guess.",2
"They are the size of a jalape√±o pepper normally, they are more common in south-central Mexico, close to tropical climates.",2
I've never heard/ate these. what are they like smaller empanadas like balls of meat or what//?,2
"Yeah, nothing beats the asada tacos from the northern states! I would say Mexico as a whole eats tacos but the meats change between regions. But nobody has such an emphasis on tacos as Mexico City lol they try to make everything a taco. Have you watched Taco Chronicles on netflix? It's a great series that focuses on one type of taco per episode. There is an asada episode which covers the northern region of the country.",2
"&gt;Even the food that us Mexicans are making at home isn't quite as good as it would be if we were making it in Mexico because of the difference in ingredients.

One of the things I definitely notice when watching the various ""Ranch Kitchen Abuela"" cooking shows on youtube is how bright yellow the skin and fat is on the chicken compared to the very white, almost light-blue hued skin and fat of American commercial chicken.",2
"Just want to chime in and say that the northern states are also big on tacos. My grandmother was from Matamoros, and she made tacos de asada, picadillo, barbacoa. Taquitos (flautas) de puerco,  all kinds of  amazing tacos.",2
"You are absolutely right it is definitely always red for morisqueta. I got into general guisado mode so I thought I'd include a few options. 

Scratch the tomatillos. That's chile verde not Morisqueta.

My wife makes a fried queso cotija variant that is absolutely divine. Chicharron is a good suggestion.",2
"Oaxacan restaurants are tasty and probably the best example of a ""light"" mexican meal as they have a lot of vegetarian options.

 What you might consider is the cost to get fresh quality ingredients, especially as far east as NYC. For example, squash blossom quesadillas are very popular in that region of Mexico. The ingredients are cheap and it is a well-loved classic. But when trying to replicate it in the US, you might not have access to everything that is needed, or the cost is too much to make it viable. Now you're substituting mozzarella for queso Oaxaca,  regular flour tortillas for blue maize tortillas, and the squash blossoms had to be previously frozen to transport. The subtleties of the dish are lost a bit but it's close enough. 

I would say a lot of the Mexican food made in the US is ""close enough"". Even the food that us Mexicans are making at home isn't quite as good as it would be if we were making it in Mexico because of the difference in ingredients.",2
"I've never seen or heard of Morisqueta being made with green salsa. My family is from Michoacan and traditionally its always made with tomatoes and not tomatillos but you can make the guisado with more than just pork meat, if you like chicharron you should definitely try it out its so good but I also make it with queso seco or just the guisado alone with no meat. Top it off with a bit of cheese and sour cream and you got yourself a good Morisqueta.",2
" A **molote** is a filled, corn-based pastry usually served as an appetizer or snack in central Mexican cuisine. It consists of a dough made from corn masa, sometimes blended with mashed potatoes, that is filled with various ingredients, then fried in lard or oil. In some areas molotes are rolled into cigar shapes or ovals, in others they are formed into half moons similar to empanadas.",2
Authentic to where?,2
"Oh sorry, good point. We're from Pennsylvania in the states",2
"You did not mentioned where in the wortld do you live, and that's important because of the ingredient availability.",2
"Lol not rude absolutely. Mexico is really diverse in terms of food. We do share some flavours and dishes in the different areas (north, centre, south). 
Now, I don't want to sound rude, but the food here is not exactly as the one you can get in the US (but I don't know if you have consumed authentic mexican food tho')
I'm not from Puebla but from a nearby state, so I don't know a lot of traditional dishes from there. But you can have cemitas, mole, Puebla is known for their sweets like camotes and borrachitos. 
Mexican food is really good and you should give it a go. 
I found this page with pictures and descriptions, I hope it can help you.

"meatballs in a chipotle tomato sauce with red rice?

2lbs of ground meat

2 cups of rice

10-12 tomatoes

1/2 can of chipotle (depends on how spicy you want it if only mild use 1 or 2 chiles)

Meatballs seasoning:

breadcrumbs or panko or even crushed up ritz

salt, pepper, garlic powder onion powder, cilantro

(hard boiled eggs cut up into small pieces in the middle totally optional)

1/4 cup of uncooked (washed rice)

&amp;#x200B;

Sauce:

In blender ; add tomatoes  and chipotle

1/2 of sour cream 

1/2 bunch of cilantro

consome (chicken bullion) 1TBspn or 1 square depends on what you have

(if you don't have chicken bullion no sweat)

4 cups of chicken broth  or beef broth optional too

salt , garlic powder and onion powder. to taste

&amp;#x200B;

1. Mix all ingredients for the meatballs and make meatballs let them rest.
2. make sauce in blender and in a large pot add mixture and cook to a boil
3. cook meat balls in the oven for 350 for 30-45 until brown or in a pan on medium high heat until browned.
4. when the sauce is boilin lower to simmer and add cooked meatballs and let them simmer for 20 minutes or so. sometimes i cant wait and only simmer for 10 minutes but the longer the better so the meatballs can really get the chipotle flavoring
5. make rice :

IN a medium size pan add vegetable oil just enough to cover all of the pan and add 

1/2 cup of chopped onion (if someone doeskin like onion skip this step)

3 garlic cloves chopped cook in oil until browned and then add the rice

cook until the rice is browned. Once rice is browned add 4 cups of water or 4  1/2 cups of chicken broth. Add salt, onion powder (if you skipped the chopped onion earlier) Consome (1 chicken bullion cube or 1Tbspn of chicken bullion) stir well you can add cilantro here totally optional taste the broth and add more salt , onion or chicken buillon as needed its up to you personal taste. Once the taste is right cover and simmer on low heat for about 25 minutes check it 5 minutes before to see if its ready or if needs more water/broth. 

&amp;#x200B;

and Enjoy this is my fav mexican dish next to mole. 

Mole is the curry sauce of the mexican world.

If you have any questions feel free to ask im sure there also instructional videos on youtube if you need extra help. I personally find it helpful to watch videos before making a brand new recipe but everyone is different. Best of luck

also there is a mexican meatball soup that is to die for its 1/2 ground meat and 1/2 ground of pork . I don't know how to make it so I never have tried.",2
"Those are serranos and i use my chef knife, it's practice.",2
"Thanks for the extensive answer. The Oaxacan restaurants I‚Äôve been to have been my absolute favorite. 

So I guess this just further complicates things. Maybe the people in New York are cooking to American tastes and the food is getting lost in the transition or something.",2
"Puebla is probably the biggest foodie region of Mexico. Look up foodie tours and they'll all do Mexico City, Puebla and Oaxaca. They have a big variety of dishes and ingredients.

I don't think there would be an American equivalent to this region because the US doesn't have a huge variety of fresh ingredients like there is in the central region of Mexico.

Also, from my experience, Americans tend to like Mexican food that is more common in the northern region of Mexico. Such as burritos, a lot of cheese and dairy products, green chile, pinto beans, ground beef. The region you've mentioned is very different. Tacos, mole, tortas, quesadillas , chalupas, cemas and tortas, sopes. Like I said there is a huge variety but some of it can be off-putting to Americans because the dishes aren't well known.",2
"I didn‚Äôt want to come off as rude, but my question is, in Mexico, is Puebla known for not having the best food?",2
I don't get your question. I'm mexican. Are you asking about the food or Tourism in Puebla?,2

"I have actually heard that descriptive of grasshoppers. I would probably be able to eat them, and most likely like them, if they were ground or chopped small enough that I didn't see them!",2
cornsmut and bugs...yum (unironically),2
"Chapulines are grasshoppers and they are dry roasted. They taste nutty, with a stale grassy/herby aftertaste which is usually minimized by adding lime and salt while they roast. Huitlacoche is corn smut, a delicious edible fungus that's somewhere between a very mild cheese and a very woody mushroom in flavor.   


The biggest downside to chapulines are getting the legs stuck in your teeth. The upside? They are delicious.",2

Corn for pozole must be nixtamalized too,2

It is for pozole. You need to go through the nixtamalization process if you want to make tortillas,2

Good bot,2
"I dont think Is nixtamalized, but why dont you call the  service line of the store?",2
"It's hard to tell, it could be that it's not nixtamalized but AFAIR, there are also some brands that sell it dry and nixtamalized, the label doesn't say it is so it'd be best to assume its not.

Also it looks like it still has its head, so that's an indicator that it could possibly be non nixtamalized",2

"Les dejo la receta tal cual est√° en el libro y ya arreglada en t√©rminos modernos

*Despu√©s de lavado el arroz dos √≥ tres veces, de modo que no de desquebraje, se pone √° cocer en leche con una poquita de sal fina : despues se le agrega alm√≠bar de az√∫car blanco bien clarificado hasta que cueza bien el arroz. Ya cocido, se deja consumir hasta que espese mucho, se echa en un platon, y al siguiente dia se toman porciones de este arroz y se forman las figuras que se quiere : se revuelcan en harina, despues se frien en manteca hasta que se haya dorado la tez, y se espolvorea sobre ellas az√∫car y canela en polvo, se ponen en un platon sobre hojas de naranjo y se cubren con otras.*

Arroz; 1 taza

Leche; 2 tazas

Az√∫car; 1 taza

Agua; 1/2 taza

Sal fina; 1 pizca

Canela en polvo

Az√∫car molida

Manteca de cerdo

Hojas de naranja

Lavar el arroz bien y dejar remojar en agua unos 10 minutos, despu√©s escurrir y poner a cocer con la leche. En una olla aparte agregar el az√∫car y el agua, calentar y dejar hervir hasta que forme un alm√≠bar espeso. Ya que el arroz est√© cocido y a√∫n tenga leche, agregar el alm√≠bar y la sal y dejar cocer hasta que espese y se vea el fondo del cazo, dejar enfriar y reposar un d√≠a.

Con las manos h√∫medas, tomar una bolita y darles forma de lo que se quiera, revolcar en harina y fre√≠r en manteca hasta que se doren, despu√©s revolcar en az√∫car molida revuelta con canela y emplatar con hojas de naranjo

//Recipe in English

Long rice; 1 cup

Milk; 2 cups

Sugar; 1 cup

Water; 1/2 cup

Fine salt; 1/4 tsp

Wheat flour; enough

Grounded cinnamon 1 tbsp

Blended sugar; 1/4 cup

Lard

Rinse really well the rice and let it soak in water for 15 minutes

Boil the sugar and water together until a slightly thick syrup forms. 

Cook the rice in the milk in low heat until soft, then add the salt and syrup, let it cook again in low heat until thickens enough that you can see the bottom of the pan when moving the rice. Let it rest overnight. 

Soak your hands and grab a ball of rice, make any form you want (bigotes means mustache, so you can make them that way or squares too)

Pass them in flour until well convered and fry in a pan with lard until golden brown. Put in a kitchen towel if you like.

Mix the cinnamon and blended sugar and dust the bigotes, then plate them in a bed of orange leaves.",2
salt is essential. I sometimes add chicken broth instead of water and salt,2
"No problem. I'm not sure why some assholes here are downvoting your contribution but I watched your whole video and I liked your technique. People might disagree because of your video thumbnail. You need a bit more caldo on your plate, but hey, to each their own.",2
"Thank you, I really appreciate that",2
Como los haces ? Ten√©is la receta.?,2
Pretty good. Menudo is one of those dishes that almost every house has it's own way of cooking it. I like it.,2
That was a fun watch.,2
A tortillero!,2
"so if you get them to puff up that is good, means you have hydration, heat and length of time on each side right! one thing that will help is to mix the masa and cover and let sit for about 3 mins. you will see it has become more firm because it soaked up more water so you may have to add water a tablespoon at a time and knead to get the right texture again. 

once you have cooked the tortillas, put then somewhere insulated to keep cooking. this is important! we use what is called tortillero, or tortilla keeper/holder. could be a basket or plastic. you can also just use a pot or pan with lid, just wrap tortillas in a kitchen towel so they keep steaming inside while you are making more tortillas.",2
"I wouldn't call it blasphemy... Mexican cuisine historically is one of the most fluid cuisines in the world...

Do Mexicans think it's delicious? It's Mexican food now.

Birria ramen is fucking fantastic.",2
"Get yourself one of them tortilla warming basket thingies... Put a napkin in there, and as your tortillas come off, pop them in and put the lid on, let them hang out for a bit. The residual heat and steam will soften the tortillas.",2
I initially had the same problem.  The fix is to keep them warm in a kitchen towel as you cook the rest (I also think there are special containers/baskets for this purpose as well).  The residual heat allows the tortillas to steam and soften.  I give them about 10-15 minutes in the towel.,2
"I have been cooking them at a high temperature, but I'm going to try medium/medium hot",2
"If it feels heavy, looks like bread pudding. Really common product at any mexican bakery. Yesterday's bread becomes today's pudding. Usually its dense, sweet and nice despite of being simple.

They will turn pan de dulce into pudding and bread into breadcrumbs usually.",2
"In a pinch you can use any. But Mexican oregano will pair better.

Regular oregano is an Italian and Mediterranean spice with minty undertones. ... Mexican oregano has lemon and citrus flavors as well as some tones of licorice. These flavors are a better fit with Mexican dishes. It is often found in chili and salsas because it pairs beautifully with spicy chile peppers.

Awesome! Thanks. I have some cheek meat for barbacoa in the freezer right now so I can definitely divert some for this üòâ,2
I used chicken thighs.  Turned out amazing!  Loved dipping the tortillas before putting them in the pan to crust up. That opened up my eyes to a whole new world.,2
Recipe?,2
"I did the same! Used chuck roast and some beef soup bones. 

I also did browning and pressure cooker. 10/10 highly recommended.",2
"Yes! [here it is](https://www.mexicoinmykitchen.com/beef-birria-recipe/). Instead of oxtail and cheek like she calls for (not available at my grocery store) I used a chuck roast and it was still great. I opted to brown it in chunks and then pressure cook everything for 1 hour. To make the tacos you dip the tortillas in the broth from the meat first then put them on the griddle with cheese, meat, cilantro, onion",2
That's so cruel. Aren't those things on the brink of extinction?,2
I will thank you!!!!,2
My wife just saw that and asked if there's a recipe for that haha,2
