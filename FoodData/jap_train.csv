"That's my go-to karaage recipe. As long as you have a decent instant read thermometer, it's pretty bulletproof. I mix the potato flour and regular flour in a ziploc and do a Shake and Bake sort of thing. Made it with my son a dozen times; he's always making big batches and bringing it to his high school extracurriculars and it's always a big hit. I've bought a cast iron wok just to handle the volume. Works great for tonkatsu as well.",0
"Dang, that’s a nice cook.",0
Nah not lacking rice. But I think it’s MSG that I could be lacking. Didn’t know the flavor of that stuff made such a difference.,0
"Interesting. Most other sites I've looked at just said you can't freeze it, period. I'll definitely try that. Thanks!",0
My local hibachi place also adds a ton of butter (or maybe it’s margarine),0
"From thewasabicompany.co.uk 

Can it be frozen if I can’t eat it all?

We do not recommend freezing whole rhizomes. Grated wasabi can be frozen if it is done immediately after grating. Grate the wasabi and wrap with cling film. Make sure the wasabi is protected from the air by wrapping tightly.",0
Wasabi root and powder are 2 different things. Powder contains no wasabi. And you would be ruining your fresh wasabi.,0
Mixed with a bunch of other dry spices. I'm not stressed about buying it; I use it often enough. I'll just do something else with the root.,0
"Potatoes aren't expensive and keep a lot longer than wasabi does. I wanted to know if I could use it in this recipe so it doesn't go to waste. If I can't, I can't. You don't need to be so cynical about it.",0
"This has got to be the most ridiculous troll question ever.

I have potatoes but my recipe calls for instant mashed potatoes.  Does anyone know how to convert my potato to instant mashed potato powder so I can add water and make mashed potatoes?",0
How is the wasabi powder supposed to be used in your recipe? There’s probably a way you can just use your wasabi root instead of buying a whole new ingredient.,0
Great job!! It looks like it’s from a restaurant 😊,0
I have a wasabi root and a recipe that calls for wasabi powder. :) But if it can only be done at an industrial scale I might as well go to the store and buy some. Shame to leave the root unused though...,0
I don’t think it works like that. I suppose you -could- use a food dehydrator. I’m curious why you want to do it.,0
"Grate it, dehydrate it (freeze dry would be better but prohibitively expensive for home use), run it through progressively finer spice/flour mills. Then pass through grading sieves to finish.

The more interesting question is why do you want to?",0
"Hahah I’m not going to deny that!

"Have you tried using 中華料理-type 鶏ガラスープ (Chinese-cooking type chicken carcass boillion)? It’s an ingredient used in many “Chinese food” dishes in Japan (like chahan, stir-fried meat with peppers, chili ebi, etc.) It has that very rich, salty, wonderful umami flavor.

"Japan Agriculture that runs co-ops where local farmers can bring fresh fruits and vegetables to sell.  Most towns have several JA farmers markets and sone grocery stores also sell JA produce.  It's cheaper and fresher than the regular fruits and vegetables the market has. But often of limited choices and supply and by early afternoon there may not be much left.  For example, this evening I needed to buy cabbage, normally we pay 100 yen for a big head of JA cabbage.

My wife's aunt has a small plot of farm land about an hour and a half away from us and whenever we stop by she gives us several bags of whatever is ripe, normally in a larger quantity than we can ever eat",0
We have that here as well. Since where I’m at is popular for it persimmons I see a lot of those instead. But yes I understand the inconvenience of locating them. But if you do by chance get to know the farmers of the these plots of land or just have friends that own such land chance are you’ll have more vegetables than you’ll know what to do with haha,0
"We have a couple unmanned fruit and vegetable stands where I live in Japan.  Not even a camera, just a little shelter stacked with bags of fresh fruit and vegetable and a little wooden box with a hole to drop your payment in.  I have not bought anything from them because it's a bit inconvenient to remember where the one selling cabbage is and which one has onions and carrots or oranges.  Easier to just go to the JA farmers market or regular grocery store that also has JA produce.",0

The salmon is fine. Nothing’s going to happen. It’s just not ‘instagrammable’. Good effort. Keep going. On to the next one.,0
They had it with the candy section at Little Tokyo Marketplace in Los Angeles.,0
I need to find this!,0
I wish I could find that! I want to try it! My store doesn’t have it!,0
"wow! i am so thankful to hear that!!!! my family, &amp; i loved our moments at Mitsuwa!",0

"Most fish is frozen at sea. In Canada any fish that enters the country must be frozen first to kill parasites. So foreign salmon is always frozen, local salmon might be.

When professionals freeze fish it's flash frozen, not like popping it in your freezer.

No idea what regulations are in other countries.",0
[removed],0
"LOL ok thank god, i thought you had managed to make the most American sushi ever.",0
"&gt;The chances are very good that this salmon was flash-frozen if it was store bought

Is that only if it was purchased frozen or even if it was purchased in a raw form?",0
Na it’s cream cheese. My daughter likes it like that.,0
is that butter on the salmon nigiri????,0
"Thanks, honestly I do it to look good, not for the taste. I also slice it in 2 to make it more colourful.",0

Yep,0
Mandarin oranges on tuna nigiri?,0
it was pretty tasty so i don’t really mind,0
Thanks! Smoked and raw salmon tartare balls.,0
It can be tricky to cut fish into neat slices,0
That salmon don't look right....,0
Looks great!,0
Any good? Got a link please?,0
"Making a proper ramen stock can take hours or even days. That’s not even counting the time it takes to make the taré and bits and bobs that go on top. That’s where soupless ramen comes in to save the day. Going by names ranging from aburasoba to mazémen, soupless ramen includes noodles seasoned with a flavorful taré, and toppings. Within this category, my favorite is Tsuyunashi Tantanmen (literally “no soup tantanmen”). With thick ramen noodles tossed in a rich nutty sesame taré and topped with spicy pork stir-fried it’s like a distillation of the best parts of ramen but it only takes about 15 minutes to make. If you want a recipe I [have one here](https://youtu.be/55CDalKC5xE).",0
I've bought it on amazon recently!,0

[Sushi-grade](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/05/how-to-prepare-raw-fish-at-home-sushi-sashimi-food-safety.html#sushi) is a marketing term and not an indicator of food safety. The chances are very good that this salmon was flash-frozen if it was store bought and thus meets FDA safety guidelines for raw fish consumption.,0
Thats why i want to try tsukimen so bad.,0
Was it sushi grade?,0
Yeah! I like the oil a little more since you don't have to repeat it as much. And if you add in a little sesame oil you can add a little flavor as well.,0
Having wet hands also works!,0
Search Google Maps for 'Asian grocery' and try a few of the Chinese/Vietnamese/Japanese ones. Good chance you'll find it in one of those places. Hon-Dashi is a common (and delicious) Japanese brand if you're lucky enough to have Asian shops where somebody can answer questions over the phone.,0
Nice! Something I recently discovered is using the tiniest bit of flavorless oil or nonstick spray on your hands to handle the rice. Then the tiniest bit of salt to lightly season the rice as you pack it into whatever shape you need.,0
"i bought it yesterday, and it was frozen for the most part of the day",0
"Was this just frozen salmon defrosted, how old was it?",0
no,0
Soaking the broth is bad.  That’s why you have to eat ramen quick.  But thinner noodles does mean more surface area for broth to adhere to.,0
Is that salmon cooked,0
Looks delicious!,0
They seem to be doing really well! I’ve been going here at least twice a month since it all started and there’s always been a line wrapping around the building for people waiting to get in (there were a few weekday visits here and there without a line in the winter though),0
The edgewater location also has the restaurants. I think they might be the same :) there’s also a curry restaurant and in the middle there’s a fancy mochi shop + a mochi donut store. I always have a hard time deciding what to eat when I’m there. Good tip about getting there around 7 though!,0
What’s wrong with wanting to practice your language skills and improve them with native speakers. I speak Chinese and like to practice at Chinese restaurants and supermarkets if I hear them speaking Chinese first.,0
Love Mitsuwa! We used to take field trips there in HS Japanese class ❤️,0
I'm 5 minutes from Edgewater Mitsuwa and I go there probably at least 2 or 3 times a week. Usually during the week when the parking lot is much less crowded.,0
"Ok, how is it when I make tataki the edges are rough (like yours) but in every freaking video the edges come out super clean?

Or we overcooking? Knife not sharp enough? Someone! Anyone! Plzzzz! 🤣",0
"The store is way bigger with more variety, but the edgewater one seems a little more polish/upscale than the 3 mitsuwa in the LA area.",0
Wow ckean and fresh looking food!,0
[removed],0
Yeah that's what I was thinking. Unfortunately my nearest japanese store is about 10 miles away and I can't get there today. Thanks a lot for your help👍,0
"No, you'd have to go to a specialist Asian, preferably Japanese supermarket to find it.",0
"Thank you, that's really helpful. I was hoping to walk in and buy it off the shelf but my 3 main supermarkets don't seem to have it, same with yuzu. Think I'll order yuzu and ponzu from souschef so I have it for next time.",0
"It's basically soy sauce with yuzu which tastes a bit like orange and lemon combined. You can get yuzu and ponzu in the UK though. They sell it at souschef.co.uk. Yuzu is a beautiful flavour, one of my favourite fruits.",0
"Thank you for the quick reply, I'll check it out!",0

"they are amazing, i don't know how they have been impacted, since Covid 19. with Enoki mushroom recalls here. But last time i was there, they are so great! especially fish row....we used to order their sashimi, have it with rice, ginger &amp; fish row. Amazing!",0
"Hey! Thanks for replying and the help.  

  
I thus compared some pictures of raw octopus and boiled octopus on google, and youtube and determined mine was pre-boiled!  
However turns out there are so many misleading pictures as well of ""cooked"" or ""raw"" octopus on the net.  

If i'm not mistaken ... if the interior of the octopus is opaque white, then it has been pre-boiled.  If it is some kind of greyish white then it's not cooked yet.  

Now that i know i'm a bit more confident buying it again. lol

Thanks again",0
Is it true that tinner noodles soak up more of the broth?,0

"The Mitsuwa in San Diego, CA has 3 small restaurants. One with great Tonkatsu and another with good ramen. Sushi and other meals are are made fresh at their Sushi station and packaged for sale. Odd that this station isn't a restaurant, but you won't find grocery store sushi like this anywhere else. Around 7PM everything is hugely discounted since they don't keep anything overnight. Walk through the isles to stock up on Japanese chocolates and candies, pickup a Pocari sweat or Calpis drink. Then walk a few steps to their Anime and toy shop.   Wrap up some grocery shopping and leave Mitsuwa and go two doors down to ""The Book Store"".

You walk in and while they do have books, you notice it's all Manga. And in the inner isles, used electronics for sale. Game systems, computer monitors, games, arcade sticks, anime toys and statues. Sometimes you'll find hard to find gaming accessories just sitting there for great prices.",0
"Miso is fine for years.  It might dry out if not stored properly, that's about it.",0
Not where I live. Most of the Japanese-Americans left their jobs at restaurants and retail to more professional work.,0
Haha yeah I bet! I’d work for toro nigiri straight up! That stuff is my kryptonite 😂,0
"I haven't heard of it but if I'm ever down that area I will try! I'm from Bergen County, so majority are Korean owned. I actually worked in a sushi place as a server part time a few years back. Getting free samples of Toro nigiri was the highlight.",0
"I liked it so much, I had it again!

I was touring across Japan on a bike, and today I did the northern loop of Lake Biwa (gorgeous) towards Hikone castle. I missed Rai Rai Tei so badly I took a slight detour (8km) into the city of Nagaham to get some!

This time I lifted the noodles so I thought I should share again. Those noodles are da best!

It probably takes us the same amount of time to get there 😂,0
Couldn’t have said it better!,0
"Will do! In my area, all the sushi places are run by Koreans and Chinese (I am Korean American myself and live in a large Korean community). While they're all good, I want the experience of getting sushi made by a Japanese chef haha.",0
Oh wow I’ll have to see if I can visit one in CA then! I can’t imagine it being what it must be like :),0
That’s awesome! It’s the best Japanese market I’ve been to in the US! You totally need to try their sushi! It’s super fresh and very reasonably priced!,0
"I love Mitsuwa! I see from the comments that this is the NJ location, which is the one I go to!  
  
I actually haven't gotten the sushi there yet, but I'm dying to try it.",0
Eastwick. (Elizabeth),0
In daiso they’re all Japanese...,0
Mitsuwa is basically better than Disney world.,0
Yea unfortunately the Mitsuwas are not by any major freeways here. And the closest one by me moved further out. If you’re ever back here try going to Tokyo Central in Gardena. Basically the same type of store but on steroids and right off a major freeway.,0
"**No offense** but, why do you need to speak Japanese in a grocery store in America? A majority of the workers in the Japanese grocery stores where I live also aren't Japanese anyways, but I live on the west coast. I would understand it if your English level isn't that great like my parents and need to speak a language you're comfortable with...",0
"I am envious. Whenever my husband goes to California for a work trip in LA area, I tag along with him to hit up the different mitsuwa in the area. The edge water  one in NJ is no where nearly as nice (although still awesome compare to other Asian grocery stores here) as the California ones and it’s extremely hard to get to... like get off an exit and immediately cut across 4 lanes to get off again. :(",0
I live in Pine Brook. How about you?,0
Where in Jersey you from?,0
Yummy!,0
Lol that’s great!,0
The workers at daiso were shocked lol. They didn’t speak to me in English after they found out lmao,0
That’s awesome! I’ve started learning through Duolingo :) it’ll be good to practice there once I start getting a better foundation,0
"I’m comfortable speaking Japanese, so this is literally where I feel comfortable and It’s a  place I can practice and buy ingredients and gifts for myself lol",0
100% worth it! It’s starting to get as busy as it was before all this happened. The parking lot was so full and they expanded the seating in the food court. Next time I’m gonna have to get some katsu!,0
Bruh that drive to edgewater is so worth it tho! It’s tough tho,0
Same here! I’d visit every day if it was closer to my house 😂,0
"awwww, that’s so cute!! thanks for sharing that!",0
Mitsuwa is my heaven,0
"Oh, you want [small sushi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZtIDeNk2aI)?",0
Yeah we’re super fortunate to have one here! I love that place!,0
I did not know they have a Mitsuwa on the east coast. I live in California and we have three in our state. I love it!,0
"About as important as the ""best use by date"" on cheese.",0
That’s the one I go to! I hope they expand though. Everyone deserves to have one near them :),0
Need a Mitsuwa near Philly....have to go to Jersey near NYC if I want to go,0
"Alright good to know, thank you!",0
"Too much bonito on your okonomiyaki....

Lol couldn't even type that with a straight face. That all looks delicious!",0
No real knowledge from my end here but I've used a miso paste that expired 3 years ago for a few months now without any problems.,0
"I'd contact the sellers. 

Best use by date just means it will supposedly taste best if used by this date but still safe to eat.

Miso is meant to be stored long term. I mean if you make it at home you ferment it in a jar for a few months to several years. In your fridge it will last far longer.",0

Their salmon is incredible! Highly recommended!,0
It’s never too late! At least you discovered it and can go back anytime! Totally agree! They have the best selection!,0
Thank you so much! I would imagine it says on there if it has been pre-cooked. I bought sashimi-grade octopus and it said it was boiled already,0
"Hey these look really good as if from a restaurant! 

Incidentally I bought octopus from a japanese grocery store too. I am actually hunting for easy to make octopus recipes... But takoyaki is too hard for me at the moment. 

If you dont mind 
May i ask if you know how to tell if the frozen octopus i bought is cooked already or if i need to boil it /simmer it before using?

Thank you!",0

"the goku-uma “hot” flavor is the only ramen i’ve ever had where the bowl version is better than the pack version. usually imo it’s the other way around. broth tastes less three-dimensional, fewer toppings/veg, etc. the goku-uma bowl broth is better imo and it comes with big pieces of green onion and chili threads which the pack doesn’t have for some reason",0
Thanks! Rice+ume is definitely a winning combo,0
"Santouka is good for what it aims to be.  Consistent and good quality every time, a bowl of Santouka in SoCal, is going to taste just as good as one in Seattle, or one in Chicago.  But it won't beat a top grade shop in SoCal, or most moderately good shops in Japan.",0

"I was able to go a couple months ago. You know the one ramen shop that always has a line to the bathroom hallway? I normally avoid it and go to a different shop, but because they were so limited on allowing customers in there wasn't a line. Gotta say, not up to the hype in my opinion.

Costco or Trader Joe’s! They reheat great in an air fryer.,0
honestly I am a novice to eating japanese food so I don't want to make any enemies for life but personally when I had okonomiyaki it was very much an acquired taste to put it politely. It was incredibly fishy from soooo many bonito flakes and then it mostly just tasted like a spoonful of japanese mayo because there's soo much.,0
Trader Joe's is pretty spot on and sooo easy to heat up.,0

The trick is to lightly oil the pan then add the water (1.5cups) turn on the heat and put on a lid. Let them steam until the water evaporates and the oil caramelizes and then plate.

It has instructions for both. I went with the oven,0

That's mostly for reference though, I probably wouldn't buy it from there because that's pretty expensive. But yeah, I always get Hikari white and Hikari red, and the two together work well for pretty much any recipe I need them for, especially soup of course. The white is much milder, I would probably recommend a white miso if you're trying it for the first time. The red is much richer and saltier and has little pieces of barley visible in it, I would get it if you try the white and feel you'd like a stronger flavor from it.",0
"Yep, crisped and browned quite nicely :) - just used a regular non-stick pan with a bit of oil, let it get nice and hot first.

Edit: forgot to say, maybe it's a matter of how thick you make it too? Mine was probably just under 2cm thick, or so.",0

I ferment radishes occasionally, which is just fresh vegetable in a salt and water brine, allowed to sit at room temperature for at least a few days.  When I do red radishes, the red color leaches out.  The radishes themselves lose the deep color, and the water takes on a pink color like this.

Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil. Gently lower the eggs (still cold from the fridge) into the boiling water, and let simmer for 7 minutes (for a slightly-runny yoke) or 8 minutes (for a soft, but set-up yoke).
Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes, transfer the eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Wait at least 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then carefully peel away the shell and slice in half, lengthwise. Set aside until ready to serve.",0

looks good but man that video was kinda brutal to watch... like 90% was basically the same thing over and over,0
"Cheapest way is rice flour, sugar, water, pestle and a microwave though this technique is largely used for wagashi. It works if you’re making suama mochi/shiratama dango/daifuku and others of the like. Recipes that fall into this category often use Joshinko, fine rice powder that leaves these sweets with a firm texture, and Shiratamako, a crumbly/coarse flour that leaves these sweets soft. (Funny how that works eh? The wonders of science and cooking...)

There are other varieties of flours used but these two are the most accessible in Japanese grocers in America and the most frequently used in these types of recipes (in my experience).

If you wish to have a neutral base for savory/sweet/or something in between, homemade mochi from scratch is the best. This is largely just made from rice and water. Like some others said here, mochitskui is an event during the New Years where you can easily obtain it. Portland, Oregon holds this type of event on one of their school campuses and it’s quite lovely (I went a couple years back before the whole pandemic) though I’m sure plenty of other cities with large Japanese populations celebrate as well. (Or you could go to Japan lul)

Apologies for the ramble. There are two methods to make at home, those being with a stand maker or a mochi maker and an adapter. The latter is the superior method tho it’s a steep investment. On Amazon, they go anywhere from 200-400$ depending on the brand. I’ve been meaning to get my hands on one but haven’t had the chance 😔 

I hope this helps. If you’re looking for a stand mixer plain mochi recipe or just wagashi type sweets, I highly recommend Just One Cookbook (JOC for short) and Cooking With Dog’s YouTube channels as well as their blogs online if you haven’t already. Best of luck, have a wonderful day 🍀",0

"Pounding mochi is usually done for special events, like sometimes I visit a Buddhist temple with my family during December to watch it (mochitsuki). At some homes, families have mochi machines that they generally use for food. Generally individual packets of mochi blocks are bought and are boiled down, toasted, or microwaved to eat. The texture of these are stiffer.  


For daifuku, the consistency of the dough is more flexible and soft, and you would need to use glutinous rice flour instead. Dango and kashiwamochi is made with non glutinous rice flour or a mix of both. My friend uses a mochi machine to make yomogi/kusa mochi and it usually comes out stiffer. Local mochi shops in America also use machines for wagashi like suama. Depends on your preference. I prefer using rice flour because it’s easy and inexpensive.",0
"Man, the things they do with strawberries.
When I was there, I tried every strawberry dessert I could get my hands on 😩",0
"They're very similar, but the main difference comes from how the cakes are leavened based on what I've seen looking at different shortcake recipes. The Japanese variation uses whipped eggs to get the rise in the cake whereas the other variations I saw use baking powder or baking soda. I'm ultimately not sure how different a cake with baking powder versus whipped eggs would be texture-wise, but supposedly the whipped eggs method yields a lighter cake.",0
"yea different types require different water amounts.
if you can no longer tell the grains apart then it's too much water.
personally, I would keep a log of various rices you've tried and jot down how you want to improve it for next time ☺",0

"short/medium grain sticky rice is roughly a 1:1 water to rice ratio.
do not trust any recipe online which provides a water ratio of 1.5 or 2:1.
also, the water amount you use for one type of rice may not work well for another.

My eyes are going to fall out.,0
"No problem! So I was interested in seeing what exactly the differences were (if any), and from what I found the main difference is that the Japanese variation of shortcake isn't leavened with baking soda or baking powder, the rise solely comes from whipping air into the eggs. I'm not super familiar with the different types of cakes, but the handful of spongecake and other shortcake recipes I looked at had either baking powder or baking soda in them, so that would be my guess as to how they differ!",0
"Thanks. So it’s exactly the same as in Australia, strawberry sponge.

I wondered as it’s the same in Aust and what I’ve seen in the UK, light sponge cake, couldn’t figure what makes it Japanese (apart from I guess this one was made in Japan)",0

"I made an [onigiri video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbZr7u0U40c&amp;t=9s) recently as well, and my technique was to put a flat layer of rice, add the filling to the center, cover it with more rice, form a rice ball, and shape it into a triangle using cupped hands.

I do agree with the other commenter on using less water for your rice since it looks pretty wet. Also keep your hands wet when forming the onigiri so the rice doesn't stick to your hands.

Regardless it looks really tasty!!",0
"Ha, I saw this on twitter earlier, so when I saw the picture here I was oh hell no, somebody is posting Marc's mapo tofu for karma! But I see now all is good haha.

I am a massive fan of the sichuan version (specifically your version actually), but I do think the first mapo tofu I ever had was the House Foods boxed kind, so someday I will need to give this a shot!",0
brilliant,0
Thank you! The final product was well worth the work.,0
"Taste-wise the Japanese version is savory and sweet with just a hint of spiciness. The Sichuan version is extremely spicy with a tongue-numbing sensation coming from the Sichuan pepper. They're both good, just in different ways.",0
Good job!,0

"Hahaha, thanks for being one of the first to watch it!",0
is that sugar that's sprinkled on top?,0
Thank you very much!,0
"This version uses a sauce based on Mirin, Oyster Sauce, and Miso. Mapo tofu would typically have ground szechuan pepper and a spicy fermented black bean sauce in their place with most everything else staying the same (Some stock/soybean oil+starch w/ ground meat and tofu). 

There are different versions of it but its typically pretty spicy. Szechuan pepper also has an interesting numbing effect on your mouth when you eat it so its a pretty unique kind of spicy.",0
"I love mabo dofu :)

Watched norecipe's video on youtube before this and found this picture looked real familiar to the one in the video.  Glad to know you have a reddit account. :)",0
what differentiates the sichuan version to the japanese one?,0
That could do it. Onigiri is usually filled with a relatively small amount of something fairly concentrated (i.e. salty).,0
Thank you. After watching your video I think I overfilled it!,0
Oh. My. God. That looks amazing 😍😍😍,0
Pounding steamed glutinous rice is the traditional method of making mochi. It makes a firm sticky mochi which needs to be eaten within a few hours or it gets hard. Once it hardens it is usually either toasted (this creates a nice crisp crust and tender interior) or boiled in soup to soften it. It can also be cut up and fried to make rice crackers. Using glutinous rice flour is the modern way of making mochi and it creates a softer smoother mochi. This can be made without any special equipment and it's usually how most people make it at home.,0
"Great job for your first try! The key is to make a cup out of the rice first, put the filling in, and then cover it with a lid of rice. I have a [video that might help](https://youtu.be/lUj47oDCywY) you with your technique.",0
Thanks! It's a regular staple in our household (though I do mix it up with the [spicier Sichuan version](https://norecipes.com/mapo-tofu/) of the dish),0
"You're welcome, I hope you enjoy it!",0
Cut off some of the meat i guess. When I buy it at the butcher he always makes sure you can roll it. In denmark we have our own version of it so i guess its common that way here.,0
Heaven in your mouth especially with some ice cream,0
"As long as it's tasty, right??

My suggestion for next time is to maybe use less water when cooking your rice, and also allow your rice to cool down completely. It doesn't have to be absolutely cold to the touch, but cooling it down will help firm up the rice grains, and hopefully keep the filling inside.",0

Yes they have a tomato basil one. It’s so good,0

"Mabo Dofu is the Japanese version of Mapo Tofu. Although my allegiance is usually with the fiery tongue-numbing Sichuan classic, this week I wanted to revisit my childhood with the milder Japanese version of this dish. Since it was introduced to Japan around fifty years ago, it's become one of Japan's most popular home-cooked meals alongside curry rice. Fun fact: Chen Kenmin, credited with creating the Japanese version of this dish, is the father of Chen Kenichi, the longest-running chef on the original Iron Chef. 

While most people use a boxed mix to make it at home these days, I have a [from-scratch recipe](https://youtu.be/s5p7qufL_rE) that comes together in under 15 minutes. Given its mild flavor profile and the ability to customize the heat level to your liking, it's a great weeknight meal that the whole family can enjoy!",0

My situation is very unique because I work at a family owned two Michelin starred exclusive Traditional Japanese food restaurant so we’re not busy at all. That’s why I’m the only one disciple and everyone else is the family members: the owner and the chef. With these three people we handle everything so i’m trained to everything from service to helping all stations. 

In other traditional Japanese restaurants, yes people spend 10 years+ going from one station to another: spend first few years doing tedious work.  We don’t serve bread or fancy desserts in traditional Japanese restaurants, so no pasty stations. 

Instead, traditionally we have these following stations from the bottom rank to top:

we do have dish washing station, commis, appetizer and hors d'oeuvre, fry, grill, sashimi and counter station to show artisan cutting skills, “saucier: or stew station where a person is in charge of seasoning everything, and finally the executive chef. With each responsible station, there might be Sous position to help the main person. 

Two very interesting discoveries after I started working at this Japanese restaurant is that one we don’t use oil at all and two unlike French where the taste is mixed or layered, we Japanese season each ingredient and pair these individual taste very well.",0

Then for the sauce I did Worcestershire + ketchup + soy sauce+ vegan oyster sauce + a little bit of sugar, mixed that up,

Then I poured half the sauce on top of the noodles (still in the microwaved container) mixed that up

Then I put the noodles + sauce into the cast iron with the cooked onion and carrots, stirred that up, added the rest of the sauce

"They are! The recipe is fairly simple: 

Daikon, carrot, cellery, Napa cabbage (and basically any other firm veg you want) cut into cubes and tossed in a fermentation crock with some dried chilies, a few garlic cloves and some chunks of rock sugar. If you want a more Chinese flavor you can add some star anise, cinnamon and whole Sichuan peppercorns. 

Make a salt solution of 5%. So if you’re using 500ml of water, use 25 g of salt. Pour it over and make sure everything is submerged. You may need to weigh it down. Use glass or food safe plastic for this NOT anything metal. I usually put a “cap” of whole nappa leaves and then put weights in that. 

Let it sit on the counter for 2-3 days. It will begin to ferment! You may have to shake the bubbles that develop out periodically so the gasses developing don’t cause it to overflow. 

After three days or so, give it a taste :) 

If you see a thin white film this is fine. If you see anything that even loosely resembles mold during those first few days, it’s compost. 

After the brine becomes acidic enough, you don’t have to worry so much about mold.",0

I got some extra fresh garlic and pork back fat (the white stuff), as well as some quail eggs.

&amp;#x200B;

There’s more pictures and additional information about this bowl here: [https://www.namajapan.tv/ramenblog/hyper-fatton-nippa](https://www.namajapan.tv/ramenblog/hyper-fatton-nippa)",0

I want that box,0
"Don't really know. I only used Kombu once for pickling cucumber and didn't need to cook it for that. I'm from Germany and we've got warning labels in all seaweeds. Iodine is the main danger thats pointed out. Kombu wasn't available as food Item because of that. 

As I wrote above I don't believe it's too dangerous.",0
"Yes, I guess that makes sense. What about the iodine tough? Should I boil it for fifteen minutes or that’s not necessary?",0
It’s actually a P65 Californian warning label.,0
Do you live in California? California has some pretty crazy food warning laws.,0
I wouldn't worry too much about it. Millions of Asians eat Kombu (and other kinds of seaweed) on a daily basis.,0
"So a Japanese bento with Italian *non so che*? I'd love to try this!

Having grown up in between culture, I've learned to love fusion food. Besides the crockery/presentation, is there anything unusual/different from a ""standard"" bento?",0
"My nana always said you eat with your eyes. She was Italian and I wonder what she’d make of Japanese plating! Anyway, that philosophy wore off in me and I always try to make stuff look as appetizing as it’ll taste. I’m glad you think it looks good!",0
"It's so elegant and dainty!

I bet it was delicious as well. Hope you enjoyed your meal.",0

Yeah even bad tempura is good IMO lol,0
Great photography.,0
Oh wow. Away into this channel I go. Thank you!,0
"The small packet is a dashi broth packet. Boil 800mL water, then adding packet for about 3 min. is a pretty standard measurement for the packets.",0
Hell yeah. I probably use way too much furikake. I love it so much.,0
Just salt eh? No usual tempura sauce?,0
"Sabi nuki onegaishimas-. I hate that stuff. Gimme some furikake, though!",0
Oh yeah. I mix a fair amount of wasabi powder into those bad boys too and it is the beeeeest.,0
"I could eat a cold tuna mayo onigiri pretty much any time, any day. I'd love to have one right now.",0
"Has anyone ever been disappointed by tempura? I definitely haven't.

Looks delightful, hope you enjoyed your meal!",0
Amazing.  Wish I could get my tempura to look like that.,0
I think pouring a mixture of gelatin dissolved in hot water mixed into warm (not hot) oil might work. Maybe not as good as this specific mixture,0
I've found that [this brand](https://www.amazon.com/Rice-Seasoning-Furikake-Variety-Set/dp/B00A6ID6MU/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=furikake&amp;qid=1617219121&amp;sr=8-3) has a milder smell and it comes in a \*ton\* of different varieties.,0
Amazing! Thank you!,0
"Big packet is furikake, rice seasoning with hijiki seaweed. The smaller one says shiitake, kombu, katsuo (bonito flakes, basically), so I’m guessing it’s a ground seasoning powder with those things. Very umami.",0
Sushi looks fantastic as well,0
I wish there's Tempura restaurant in Dallas Texas,0
It do be like that.,0
I noticed in Asia specifically south east most stinky foods are good 😂,0
"Some are less fishy smelling. I'm glad it doesn't taste like it smells.
There's stinkier foods out there.",0
No doubt. My wife hates the smell but it’s good..,0

INGREDIENTS

**Soup**

* 1 quart frozen bone broth
* 4 tbsp [Shoyu Tare](https://www.absolutenom.com/2019/shoyu-tare-fixing-the-ramen-at-home-recipe/)
* 2 tbsp Green Onion Aroma Oil\*
* 1 lb. fresh noodles\*\*

**Toppings**

* 4 oz thin-sliced slices of pork chashu
* 2 soft-boiled eggs (ajitama) marinated in the chashu cooking liquid. You can substitute plain old un-marinated soft-boiled eggs too. It’s still amazing.
* 1/2 oz dried, cut wakame
* 1/4 cup chopped green onion

**Prepared Shitake and Black Fungus**

* Four dried shitake mushrooms
* 1/8 oz. dried black fungus
* Salt
* A splash of peanut oil (or any other high-smoke-point cooking oil)
* Rice cooking wine

DIRECTIONS

**Prepping the Soup**

* Thaw out bone broth and bring to a simmer. Cover while prepping other ingredients.

**Prepping the Chashu**

* Heat a smear of peanut oil in a pan on high heat
* Brown your slices of chashu in the pan until slightly crispy
* Remove chashu from pan. Do not clean the pan! You’ll use it for the mushrooms.

**Prepping Mushrooms and Fungus**

* Put the dried mushrooms and black fungus in a bowl and submerge in boiling water. Steep for at least half an hour. remove and cut out any tough areas (stems of the mushrooms etc.)
* Optional- reserve the mushroom-water and add a quarter cup or so of it to the simmering bone broth.
* In the same pan used for browning the chashu, heat a smear of peanut oil or other cooking oil and toss in the mushrooms in. Toss in a pinch of salt. Brown on one side and then add a splash of rice wine vinegar to deglaze.
* Toss in the black fungus and stir until the vinegar is more or less evaporated. Remove from heat.

**Prepping the Wakame**

* Cover dry wakame in boiling water and soak for a few minutes until chewy and still a little crunchy. Rremove and dump the remaining steeping water into the simmering bone broth.

**Prepping the Ajitama**

* If you have marinated the eggs, remove them from the marinade and allow them to come up to room temperature before slicing in half.
* If you are making new soft-boiled eggs, bring water up to a boil, add two raw eggs and stir gently for 2 minutes (to keep the yolks from sticking to one side) Then cook another 5 minutes for extremely soft boiled or another 6 minutes for a firmer yolk texture.
* Cool and peel in whichever way seems the least painful to you. This is an annoying step no matter what you do.

**Prepping the green onion**

* Thinly slice up the white and green parts of at least 2 green onions.

**Assembly**

* Get out two large bowls
* Boil the noodles till al dente.
* While noodles are boiling, add 2 Tbsp of Shoyu Tare to each bowl
* Add 1 tbsp of green onion aroma oil to each bowl
* Ladle in 2 cups of broth to each bowl
* When the noodles are done drain and put half in each bowl
* Lay the toppings gently on top of the noodles for maximum esthetic effect
* Drizzle with sesame oil, chilli pepper oil, sprinkle on sesame seeds, whatever the hell you want.
* Eat RIGHT AWAY before the noods get all squishy-like. Slurping is not optional.

NOTES

* \*Aroma oil is NOT OPTIONAL! Make some of this and store it basically indefinitely. It is super quick and freaking easy and worth it 1,000 times over. I use it in a lot of stuff.
* \*\*Traditionally, low-hydration alkaline noodles are used here. I have been using [Way of Ramen’s easy as hell recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8rsTkOsI2M&amp;t=528s) for these and I see no reason to re-invent the wheel on this blog since his are freaking perfection.

Oh wow 🤩,0
Thank you so much!,0
Looks amazing! How do you even go about eating that? Looks masive :P,0
Thank you!,0
"I love the “flying squirrel riding the autumn wind” one. Wish I could try it, I have no idea what vanilla mousse tastes like, but it sounds yummy.",0
Really cute,0
What flavors?,0
"Simple and beautiful!

The pink from the spinach ends are a nice touch",0
"Such vibrant colors in this bowl!

And that ajitama looks banging!",0
Pretty good but not my best curry. Not because of the chocolate though. I would add it again but it didn't deliver as much sweetness as I thought it would.,0
"I gotta know, how did it taste?",0
Beautiful plating and they look stunning!,0
"I add enoki to many soups. They taste almost like noodles in soup with a good texture.

You can use enoki until they start becoming slimy when you take it out of the package. In my experience this is around the one-week mark. However there are different enoki producers and some seem to last longer than others. It’s pretty easy to tell bad enoki. It just looks and feels gross. Short of that, I cook without issue.",0
Cute! Looks like they would taste actually good too.,0
"Oh tempura sounds great, I'll have to try... and yeah, I think I just may be used to my local trader joes where the produce starts going bad the second I look at it.",0
They are cute!,0
"Tempura style (deep fry with batter) and in sukiyaki are two of my favourite ways to enjoy enoki.

Most of the produce in my fridge last more than a week :)",0
So adorable!  I love them all!,0
Miso is a [paste](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/what-is-miso-paste/) from fermented soybeans. It adds a ton of Umami to a dish and makes for a fantastic soup. They are available in most grocery stores nowadays. Try it the next time you eat Japanese. You will not regret it.,0
"i've never had miso, isn't that like bean sprouts? what does miso soup taste like? i've seen it at restaurants and even found a recipe to make for my vegetarian brothers-in-law (couldn't find all the ingredients tho). i imagine it would taste/feel kind of crisp and light.",0
"In the Winter, I crave a big mug of Miso Soup right after I wake up. Filling, warming, and tasty.",0
"They probably meant that it evaporates faster, not dissolve. Dissolve in the sense of dissolving into the gases lol",0
The presentation is perfect!,0
"Adding chocolate to a brown curry or something like chili con carne is a great idea! But I strongly recommend you find a chocolate with a higher concentration of cocoa than hershey's for next time. 

It's not even a matter of light vs dark chocolate. Hershey's has such a high amount of cocoa butter and milk solids that it's more of a chocolate spread than a chocolate bar, which is why it can melt at just above room temp. This makes it perfect for adding on top of hot baked stuff, like nanaimo bars, but not so appealing for savory dishes imo.

I recommend looking for ghirardelli or some other bar brand that can offer at least 40% cocoa (I prefer using 70%-80%). You'll find that the flavor is deeper, you're adding less sugar, and that when the chocolate melts it forms more of a rich spanish mole texture than a creamy milk chocolate one. They sell these bars in the baking section and/or candy section in the grocery store. Yes, they're like $3-$4, but three squares is a good amount for cooking with, so the bars tend to stick around in the pantry for quite a while.",0

Too beautiful to eat.,0
Can you offer any hints on how to make such perfect tornado omelets?,0
"That's fantastic, looks delicious. I've been practicing my tornado but can't get it right yet. A few more batches and I should have it",0
!!! Glad I can spark some inspiration! They were much easier than expected and definitely fun to make. I wish you the best of luck in your rice-ball-decoration adventures!,0
"Oh my, that looks good. Time for some Japanese curry. I make myself an omelet most every day for lunch (grateful to be able to work at home to do this).",0
Oh not at all! I’m really grateful. There is no other way I would have known since I don’t speak Japanese and I’m really happy to know the proper name.,0
Finally a cute rice ball decoration I think even I can handle!! Thanks for the inspiration!,0
That is so adorable.,0
"Sorry if that came across as rude, I totally didn’t mean it to be! I just wanted you to have the proper name
We do still eat namul here but usually if we go to a yakiniku restaurant or you can buy it as a pack including kimchi etc.",0
"Oh thanks!!! I knew it was a Korean word, but I thought it was a loan-word because it shows up in many of the Japanese cookbooks I have. I’m really glad to have the actual name of it now. Thanks very much!

Also I ran out of katsobushi or it would have been there. I put that deliciousness on EVERYTHING now.",0
I learned something new. Thank you,0
Looks delicious!!!!,0
Namul is the Korean name so we would say ‘spinach/hourensou ohitashi' for that in Japanese. I've been eating that and kinpira constantly recently. Throw some katsoubushi on that spinach and it’s delicious!,0
"Oy. Somehow, I knew how to behave with chopsticks but didn’t get the rice thing.",0

"I grew up eating the Korean version (samgak kimbap), which had Korean fillings. After being inspired by Japanese cooking games, I tried making onigiri! These ones have mayo tuna, spicy mayo tuna, and okaka (bonito flakes and soy sauce).

For detailed steps on how I created the onigiri shape nicely (and to watch an awesome onigiri dance party), watch [my video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbZr7u0U40c)!

Ingredients:

For mayo tuna filling:

1. 50g tuna
2. 1.5 tbsp mayo
3. 1/2 tsp soy sauce
4. 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper

For gochujang tuna filling (spicy):

1. 50g tuna
2. 1 tbsp mayo
3. 1 tsp gochujang (Korean red pepper paste)

For okaka filling:

1. 1/4 cup bonito flakes
2. 1/2b tsp soy sauce

For rice:

1. 2 cups cooked rice
2. 2 tbsp furikake (can sub with sesame seeds and roasted seaweed)
3. 1/2 tsp salt

2 sheets of nori

Instructions:

1. Mix all three filling ingredients.
2. Mix cooked rice with furikake and salt.
3. Cut 2 sheets of nori in half 3 times (refer to video) to get small strips.
4. To assemble the onigiri, keep a wet towel nearby to keep your hands wet (wash your hands first!). This will prevent rice from sticking to your hands.
5. Layer 2-3 tbsps of rice on your hand.
6. Add about a tbsp of any filling on top of it.
7. Cover your filling completely with rice on top (you'll need around 2 tbsp).
8. Press gently with both hands to create a rice ball.
9. Cup one hand to create a point and squeeze the rice ball firmly on three points to create a triangle (refer to video for clarity).
10. Wrap one side of the rice triangle with a sheet of nori.
11. Repeat with the rest of the ingredients.
12. Enjoy!",0
thank you! def will!,0
Thanks so much!,0
"I used firm tofu in this one because it's what I had on hand. I think it would have been even better with silken tofu or soft tofu. :D The company I buy my tofu from is Fresh Tofu Inc. [https://freshtofu.com/site/](https://freshtofu.com/site/)

They're somewhat local to me and I really really like the taste.",0
"Wow! Thanks for the tip! Honestly I just did that because food porn. I had no idea of the cultural significance, so thanks so much for letting me know. Fluffy for the future for sure :D",0
Everything looks really good,0
"Hey, looks delicious.  Just a quick note though, when you serve rice in a rice bowl, you don't want to shape it into a mound like that as that's the general shape used at funerals (though you would also have chopsticks sticking up in that case).  

Japanese people prefer to serve the rice ""fukkura"" or ""fluffy"" with natural air pockets in between each grain.  If you're serving rice on a plate like for curry or for fried rice then you can shape it into the rice mound thing.",0
Looks amazing! What kind of tofu did you use?,0

I added three squares of Hershey's to one while box of Golden Curry roux. Didnt wanna go overboard the first time,0

"Pork or beef is usually used so I’m not quite sure how it would turn out with other meat. I imagine chicken thigh would also work, but it would change the dish a bit. 
If you can’t eat that it’s worth trying turkey, I’m sure it would still taste great!",0
"for now i am not eating meat, can i do this with fish &amp; potatoes? :) this sounds really good!!",0
"I just realized I never replied to this. Sorry! Kinpira just has a simple flavor, like I said It only uses spice, soy sauce, sugar and sake. 
Niku jaga is is meat and potatoes. It’s really hearty but not too heavy. They are both delicious and easy to make!",0

So cute,0
onaka hetta- 😋,0
"To make people “smile“, so make sence. Lol",0
"&gt; Another product mentioned fatty acids from sesame seeds somehow.

I think that might be a mistranslation. The Johnson &amp; Johnson page says 唐ゴマ (tougoma) which is the caster bean plant. However, ゴマ (goma), by itself, is the sesame plant. A lot on non-sesame plants have goma in their name despite being unrelated. エゴマ/egoma is another. I'm not sure the reason.",0
"Uhhhh... So... I don't think I'm going to be attempting to fuck around with castor beans. Ricin is present in raw beans, so if you don't cook them properly before dealing with them you can die a horrible death. Ricin poisoning is one of the most gruesome types of chemical death for humans.

A friend who has a PHD in biochemistry made his pregnant wife wash and scrub her hands extensively after handling castor bean seeds in the garden one year. He's not usually prone to hysterical overreactions, so we all decided maybe castor bean plants are not for us... 😅

Another product mentioned fatty acids from sesame seeds somehow. I wonder if tahini would work? That's just sesame oil, though, so probably not.",0
"According to the [Johnson &amp; Johnson product page](https://scjcatalog.johnson.co.jp/products/brand/tempuru.html), it's made of fatty acids extracted from the [caster oil plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricinus).",0
"I think I've only deep fried things twice in the last decade. I lived in Japan for a couple years, and I was impressed at seeing how easy it was to dispose of oil using katameru tenpuru (oil hardener granules). The mess and hassle of cleaning up after deep frying anything just didn't seem worth it once I moved back to Canada.

But, I miss my family's corn fritters recipe, and I want to try making agedashi dofu occasionally, and also maybe crullers or apple fritters. But I'm still missing that easy cleanup that I got used to in Japan. 

Anyone know what those little granules are made of? Is there a way to make it at home, or just buy the chemical in bulk somewhere? Amazon.ca seems to have a few VERY expensive packets of katameru tenpuru, but... I'm also cheap in addition to lazy. Ha!

Any info on this would be great. None of my local asian grocery stores seem to carry this product.",0

"This is more of a method of cooking, usually done at the table hot pot style.  The most important part is the sukiyaki sauce.  I use equal parts sake, shoyu, and mirin with a dash of sugar.  It is really strong so you'll dilute it with dashi or water as you cook and eat.  

The meal generally starts with some thin slices of beef,  often ribeye, fried in your cooking pot.  You'll then add veggies, sauce, dashi and simmer, adding more meat or veg as desired.  Many people will dip each bite in raw beaten egg right before eating which may seem strange but is super delicious.

You'll finish by having the remaining sauce and broth over noodles!

The veg your seeing is bok choy, gai lan, negi, king oyster, and cremini mushrooms along with shirataki noodles in the center.  You can use whatever you like though!

There are many variations on this dish and this is just the way my family has always prepared it.  If you've ever had a beef bowl at Yoshinoya you'll be familiar with the flavor profile here.

I highly recommend the article on Just One Cookbook as they do a great job of explaining the minutiae of this dish.",0

"Tamagoyaki, yakisoba/udon, butadon/gyudon, miso soup, mentaiko pasta. Mmm, now I want tamagoyaki again.",0
"I actually managed to do a in oven yakitori recipe that's pretty good. 400° 20min with only salt and pepper, you place a grill (like the one you use to cool off cookie) on top of a pan sheet line with aluminium paper. after those 20 minute put the oven at broiled, cover with sauce, when it start having nice colour, turn it around, more sauce. you can do that cycle twice but my sauce is nice an thick so once is enough. it's missing the charcoal taste appart from that it's pretty good",0
"My recent favorites include yakisoba, karaage, tonjiru (miso based soup with pork belly, konnyaku, veggies and sesame oil) and curry. I should make a new attempt to do a Go Go curry dupe, that's my Japanese cuisine holy grail :D",0
I second gyudon. Its easy and very cheap! Ive been making a lot of onigiri as well. Both take only about 15 minutes.,0
"You can use whatever you want, considering it's a soup I made up one day and then replicated with measurements lol! I just had bacon at the time and thought it went nicely with the broth.

I'm also not eating meat atm, and I can assure you the soup still tastes excellent without it!",0
i have actually never tried it) i have yet to try it.,0
"they are so good, enjoy!)))",0
for sure!,0
"Castella Pancake Recipe ➡️ https://youtu.be/wUCHYHKKVvM

I've written down the ingredients for you in grams. If you would like more tips you can check the video. Have fun baking and Enjoy! 

INGREDIENTS:

FOR THE CASTELLA

* 2 Large Egg Yolk
* 1 tbsp Honey
* 2g Vanilla Extract 
* 18g Vegetable Oil
* 33ml Milk
* 76g Strong Bread Flour 
* 3g Baking Powder 
* 2 Large Egg Whites
* 76g Caster Sugar

FOR THE TOPPING

* Butter 
* Icing Sugar
* Maple Syrup 

I recommend a 6.5 inch (16.51cm) cast iron skillet pan.

Preheat the oven to 180°C.
Separate the eggs. Place the egg whites into a large mixing bowl and chill in the fridge.
Add honey and milk to the egg yolks and whisk until well mixed. Sift in flour and baking powder and mix.
Using a clean whisk, whisk the egg whites until pale and frothy. Add 1/3 of the sugar at a time and continue whisking until medium soft peaks.
Add 1/3 of the meringue to the egg yolk mixture and fold. Then return all the mixture into the egg whites and fold. 
Pour the batter onto the skillet and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the oven for 6 mins, then take it out and cut a cross at the top with a small knife. Then turn down the oven to 170°C and bake for another 18 - 20 mins until well-risen and golden brown on top.
Serve immediately with butter, icing sugar and syrup.",0

my fave!,0
"just made tomago yesterday!) made a delicious bento meal: japanese macaroni (instead of ham, substituted bbq tofu), i made it a bit spicier with hot sauce. Tamago, white fish cutlet/tonkatsu/schnitzel, mashed potatoes. Honestly one of the best meals i think i have made so far. Tomago is so good!I really want to not fail at making Tamogayaki, lol. I am good at making crepes, that's what it reminds me of. You have to practice a few times.",0

really? i didn't know that! i was learning that i didnt know sake came in different types. which type of regular sake brand do you use for cooking?,0
"I started cooking Japanese/inspired food over quarantine as a new hobby. My wife and I went to Japan for our honeymoon as food tourists, so it was already an interest.

Oyakodon has become a household staple, and I've occasionally been making omurice, okonomiyaki, gyudon, katsukare, yakitori (whenever we get access to a BBQ). I also adapted another recipe into a Japanese inspired kewpie-seared steak and broccoli bowl which has gone over well.",0

haven't had daikon in a year actually...its really good. sounds delicious!,0
"sounds delicious! i don't know, where you guys are...but have you thought of looking for an Hmart? we got lucky, last time we lived near one, the meat prices were great, so was the sashimi! honestly it was like being next to a Mitsua market in Cali.",0
yum!,0
Miso soup with tofu. Easy stuff.,0
My partner and I mostly live off japanese food so we've learned to cook most of it ourselves during this time.  The best so far has been the yakiniku night we had.  Next we're hoping to find octopus a little cheaper so we can finally make some takoyaki,0
"Not as exciting as many of the other entries here, but I was getting a lot of daikon and carrots in my CSA shares this winter so I started making namasu. Its been a complete game changer - have it as a side dish for just about everything now.",0

Curry rice with tonkatsu!,0
"Chicken katsu, tamago kake gohan, and I came up with a soup that is surprisingly better than you expect it to be:

- 1 cup water

- Hondashi for 1c water per package directions

- 1.5 tbsp soy sauce

- 1/4 tsp white miso

- 1-1.5 tsp ginger juice

Simmer some small slices of bacon in the broth, add noodles and leafy greens/green onion/mushrooms, whatever",0

"Canned sardine donburi.

- Make rice.
- Drain most oil out of a couple tins of good sardines.  (The ones from costco with the skin on are ideal)  Plan on a can per person.
- Get some sort of bitter greens.  Yuchoy is ideal.  Wash, chop stems into 1/2"" pieces, keep leaves whole.
- Chop up some green onion / scallions
- Tablespoon of beni-shoga (pickled ginger) per serving
- In a small bowl, mix together a little soy sauce, sake, minced ginger.

- In frypan #1, heat up a tiny bit of neutral oil and get green stems going.  Once they are tender, toss in the leaves, add a couple tablespoons of water, put lid on, and turn heat off to let leaves steam / cook.

-In a pre-heated frypan (make sure you have a lid or a splatter shield ready to go!) empty the tins of sardines.  Let them brown on one side before flipping over and get them almost done on the 2nd side.
-Pour over the shoyu/sake/ginger mixture and shake pan, and let the sauce carmelize, but not burn.

- In an individual serving bowl (think ramen bowls) put in rice, top with sardines and greens.  Mix a little extra water in sardine frypan and bring quickly to heat, scraping bottom bits off.  Pour over each of the bowls.  Top bowls with pickled beni-shoga, scallions.",0
"I highly recommend using regular sake over cooking sake. There are benefits to both but you have more control over salt level with regular sake. With cooking sake, If you want more of that flavor it’s gonna come with the salt.",0

"Nice thing about okonomiyaki is there are many variations. As long as you follow the same techniques and use a good batter, you can put a twist like use bacon or thin marinated tofu slices. Double check though if your OK with dashi.",0
I’ve been eating a LOT of kinpira and niku jaga before the weather gets too hot again.,0

"This looks great to me &amp; I’ve read all the comments &amp; it clearly wasn’t done deliberately to be disrespectful. If someone wanted to give you advice all they had to say was “hey, putting chopsticks like that in a dish is a no no” instead of everyone harping on about it over and over again. You did nothing wrong &amp; learned something, keep cooking 🙂",0
"Generic I know, but sushi. My little brother loves it but my family is paranoid about hygiene. With all the free time I had earlier in the pandemic, I made tons of sushi for the family.",0
"You can use regular sake if you like. It’s just that cooking sake will definitely be cheaper, and it has salt in it.",0
"Yeah, I've seen those. Will definitely get some of them",0
If you want to take nice food pics with chopsticks I recommend getting chopstick holders (not sure if that's the actual English term for them) that the tip of the chopsticks rests on while on the table. There's some really cute and nice ones out there :),0
yum! curry is one of my simple faves) i made the spicier version this previous time),0

"Honest question, did you mean to make a noodle soup version? It seem a bit watery.",0

Cultural reasons aside, the katsu looks great",0
It doesn't matter I think! I normally crack egg right away!,0

"A lot of recent Japanese cooking books are heavily inspired by izakaya style cuisine, which is crazy delicious but also very meaty, sweet and salty as it's meant to be enjoyed with lager.

This book ([https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Cooking-Simple-Shizuo-Tsuji/dp/1568363885/ref=sr\_1\_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=japanese+cooking&amp;qid=1615947032&amp;sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Cooking-Simple-Shizuo-Tsuji/dp/1568363885/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=japanese+cooking&amp;qid=1615947032&amp;sr=8-1)) has a lot of traditional recipes that are super tasty but also feature a lot more vegetables and not as much salt and sugar.

Edit: On weekends with bad weather, I often cook a lot of side dishes from this book and then use them to make all sorts of salads or noodle bowls during the week.",0
Simple and beautiful arrangement of the strawberries on top! Blooming!,0
"Thank you! (sorry my keyboard is glitching) the key is crunchiness, &amp; make fish really extra crispy, like fish &amp; chips))) up to you whether to fry in butter, or olive oil like i did) for tamago flavoring i used brown sugar, sake, soy. Sake i learned brings out the sweetness. You can also just use Mirin, depending on your preferences. Add green onions for the greens)))

Also some just enjoy fish as the main meal, with sides. But was curious to see what others do. I have seen people just make it like i do with crispy fish, eggs, vegetables. Some add bonito flakes, thats if you really love Dashi, which at the moment i don't.",0
Something about square shape food really speaks to me,0
"I like making Chanko Nabe when I need to reset after a period of eating unhealthy (usually pizza binge).

Napa cabbage, carrots, daikon, chicken meatballs, tofu, plus some miso to flavor. A hot bowl paired with some white rice makes for a cozy winter meal.

Lots of variations out there to mix and swap in ingredients you like.

Best of luck on the healthy journey!",0
the strawberry looks delish! and the icing looks so good😍,0

Man why do white people keep sticking their chopsticks into rice like this? It doesn’t make the food you make seem exotic. Please stop.,0
"That sounds fantastic! I still can’t wrap my head around fish being a breakfast food, but all your sides sound super tasty.",0
"same :) I made schnitzel pollock inspired meal, with japanese macaroni tofu salad, tamago, mashed potato. But curious to see what others have on the side.",0
Thank you so much! It is apparently kyuri no kyu-chan. We are going to try and make some tomorrow,0
"Taking a picture while eating and having the chopsticks in the bowl is one thing. But sticking it straight up in a bow like this right in the middle is just deliberate and ignorant. 

And if you’re not eating it right away, don’t pour that sauce all over the tonkatsu.",0
"Death is seen as ""unclean"" in Japanese culture in general in particular, rooted very deeply in Shintō. Rule of thumb, if anything is associated with death and the rituals surrounding it, the best course of action is generally to avoid it outside of those rituals.",0

It is typically red but there is also a brown version (shown above). Did they say what kind of pickled veggie it was? That would help narrow it down.",0
"oooh Uni!

Looks great!",0
yum,0
"This is correct. It probably has to do with the diet (grass and insects), and some bit of happiness for the chickens.

Orange and a thicker yolk are two good things to have with each other",0
"Looks very tasty!!! I don’t really know why people have such a bee in their bonnet here about the chopsticks... if you were at a Japanese restaurant or someone else’s house, yeah it might be rude, but it’s clearly inside your own home. And as far as I know this isn’t a Japanese etiquette subreddit. You do you my dude. Food looks A+",0
"Did you eat this, or was this an offering at an altar for your ancestors?",0
"I've read that chickens that run around outside and eat a more natural diet of grasses and insects will have the orange yolk, whilst chickens cooped up inside and grain fed will give a yellow yolk. So I always look for eggs where it says on the box that they can run around outdoors and so far those are indeed more orange.",0
I also kinda sorta ordered their other style pot for soups and simmers. After I said I’d wait,0

"Yea it is incredibly taboo because it reminds Asian people of funerals, where a bowl of rice is left with two chopsticks standing vertically in the center. It's also supposed to bring bad luck. You don't serve food the same way to living people as you do to the dead.

Edit: pro tip- don't leave your chopsticks in the bowl. Ever.",0
This plus furikake/negi is an almost daily pre service meal for me! Love it,0

Thick cutz,0
"This is also true! I know that some farmers will even feed chili flakes to create an orange tint as well in the yolk.

There's definitely many factors to consider",0
Thanks for the thoughtful answer!,0
"I love TKG (with seaweed flakes and sometimes seasame oil too) and make it using eggs from my flock of backyard chickens. 

Contrary to recent popular belief, orange yolks do not necessarily mean better eggs. Generally the color will be more orange if the chickens eat a healthier diet with more foods containing caretinoids like greens. But orange yolks can be induced by putting caretinoid supplements in their feed. So you can have orange yolks but the chickens aren't really eating any healthier. 

*Special note: Chickens in the same flock can have different colored yolks. I can crack two eggs and one yolk will be more orange than the other because that chicken happened to eat more greens (or pumpkin or other caretinoid heavy foods) before they laid their egg.",0
"That yolk isn't Japan specific. It's too yellow, you want it to be a deep orange color. 

You can still find yellow eggs in Japan, but it's not what people would call Japan specific.",0
Definitely don't do that with the chopsticks.,0
"Good question! 
There are definitely places in japan where one can enjoy middle eastern food, such as [Al-Ain](https://www.alaindining.com/) and [Palmyra](https://www.palmyra-ameta.com/), just to name a couple. 

In terms of any direct Egyptian influence on any popular japanese dishes, I can't really think of any. It could be that certain elements of Arabic cuisine don't really mesh well with the Japanese palate, like certain yogurt sauces etc. 

I'm sure as the country relaxes it's immigration policies and encourages ties with near eastern nations, we might see more widespread interest in different cuisines. We're currently seeing a Thai food boom in influence in japanese cuisine, with local spices like coriander and coconut milk starting to show up in things like ramen.",0
looks a bit shit tbh,0
Oh I thought this photo was of a japanese egg. Such intense yellow!,0
That’s what I was hinting at.,0
Oh! We can buy the pasteurized eggs for this. But that yolk color is still Japan-specific.,0
Don’t let the Americans see this.,0
Oh my... The fatty tuna is seductive! :D,0

Rly? Sounds deep,0
While it looks really good. I don’t think you’re supposed to have your chopsticks in the bowl like that. I believe chopstick etiquette states it as offensive as it pertains to the dead.,0

It did !,0
Not in my mouth so not perfect :D,0
Wait until you see the yolk color and texture of Japanese eggs. That's true perfection,0
"Same, they make the best katsu curry imo",0
Thanks. That is a traditional doll called odairi-sama. it is used for the celebration of girls in Japan. He already went home as the date 3/3 passed.,0
Wonder if he arranged all those on the right or threw it in there randomly.,0
No not al all! They’re kumquats,0
You're killing me - I can taste it!,0
That yolk tho.... perfection,0
Lol from a japanese restaurant in Singapore. This is their limited time period festive launch 😆 not authentic but looks and tastes decent,0

I would love a more detailed recipe. 

Thanks!",0

I'm also missing the Japanese marts and have been trying to get by with some beni shoga and kimchi. I'm looking forward to trying my hands at making some fukujinzuke as well!",0

Okonomiyaki is the best thing I've ever tasted 😋,0

Yummm! I just did this for the first time myself too :) my SO is low-fodmap so I swapped out the cabbage for lettuce and it turned out really amazing!,0
Looks great! What recipe did you use?,0
"You will basically never find rolls in Japan, that's a Murican thing.",0

Looks delish!!,0
How did you make the lettuce or cabbage side??,0
I have those noodles. Its a best before date. Mine say the 2021.6.9 so definitely not the manufacturing date,0
"Thanks to covid I haven’t been able to visit the Japanese market in a year, and I love fukujinzuke and make/eat a lot of curry, so there was only one solution really. I couldn’t really find a consensus on how to make it online so I cobbled together a method of steps borrowed from a few sources and made adjustments until it tasted close to the bagged stuff I normally buy. 

I used daikon, cucumber, eggplant, and lotus root as the veg and then konbu, ginger, shoyu, mirin, sake, sugar, rice wine vinegar, and sesame seeds to flavour it. I also added a tiny bit of powdered red food colouring. 

Oh also I soaked the cut up vegetables in a salt brine for half an hour then squeezed out as much moisture as I could before continuing.",0

I would say pan fry is sufficient for sure. I have not attempted cooking them another way so can’t speak to the other methods of cooking.,0

"Thank you!! You should absolutely try, it wasn’t that hard and this cake is such a lovely way to welcome spring 🌸",0
"I’ve just started using miso as well. It’s pretty great. Although I’m starting to realize be careful of the salt content. Need to find low sodium varieties if they have it. 

So I made miso soup. Easy. You can actually put anything in the soup. So lots of variety there. 

Miso dressings, like for salad or miso Mayo mixes for like sandwiches or plate sauces. 

Haven’t tried it but I bet it works as marinade ingredient.",0

"Japanese people love onomatopoeia, and Chan Chan Yaki is named after the sound that metal spatulas make as they strike the steel griddle that this dish is traditionally prepared on. My simplified version can be made in an ordinary frying pan. It's just cabbage, carrots, onions and enoki mushrooms stir-fried until wilted. Then a salmon filet slathered with miso butter (miso, butter, and a little sugar) goes on top. This gets doused with sake and a lid goes on to gently steam. The miso butter bastes the salmon keeping it ridiculously tender and juicy, and the vegetables keep the fish off the hot pan so it can slowly steam. The result is that the salmon practically melts in your mouth. If you need a more detailed recipe, you can check out my video here: https://youtu.be/6fMvyjBXuao",0
"Wow, thanks for all the info. I believe yokan is something like agar which we have in my country but the texture might be slightly different. I've seen nanohana being mentioned as a spring vegetable in Japan, hope I get to try all this one day! Such a beautiful meal, thanks for sharing it.",0
Sekihan !? great job!,0
"No worries. Below the tamagoyaki, the black cubic rectangle is ""Yokan, Japanese sweet."" You can see a fried shrimp with its tail and fired fishcakes, next to Yokan. One down from Yokan, in that part, there are a big boiled shrimp, scallop, and mussels, beautifully cooked with dashi stock, sugar, and soy.  In sushi section, seaweed, egg, and kelp rolls, from left to right.  Next to the rolls, that was pickled sushi. The fish was yellowtail, which was deeply pickled with rice vinegar. In the past, people used rice vinegar as preservative, so this type of sushi is very traditional.  At the top right corner, we have two different sashimi, kobin and mejina as well as we have a tiny sweet called ""mizu manjuu"" over there.

And the last part, you mentioned it earlier, there is a nimono, and green veggies named nanohana, which we can eat during spring, so that nanohana can add a bit of a nuance of spring arrival in this bento.  Lastly, at the bottom left corner, that is fish cakes with veggies.

Thanks for being interested in Shidashi.",0
"You may find a way better bonto boxes at roadside stations 道の駅. It is very reasonable like 400-500 yen as well. At roadside stations, bentos are super fresh because that is the place where farmers sell their veggies and fruits. Some of them come in organic, and they have great flavours. The bentos, of course, are cooked with those ingredients. One bite gives you much!",0
"Yeah, it is a pricy side. This type of bento is called  ""Shidashi bento 仕出し弁当.""

You may want to google it, and great shidashi bentos are coming right up😉",0

Sounds good! I got excited about the new restaurant but was questioning my memory of takoyaki after eating there haha,0
"Haha, for me, no! They definitely make it look like a breeze. It took me a bit to figure out how to do the tuck and flip with a pair of skewers but I eventually figured it out.",0
"These were definitely not pudding-like inside. Hush puppy is a good way of describing them! Like a not dry, less cakey hush puppy. I also put a lot of filling in these so there wasn't tons of filler batter around them.",0
So are they as easy to flip over as the street vendors make it look?,0
How was the texture inside? A place by me opened and sells takoyaki but it was like pudding or mashed potatoes inside. When I had them before in Osaka it was more like a hush puppy..,0

Nice Haiku!,0
It’s half of the fish!,0
"Yes! 
It all depends on where you eat and how much you are willing to pay. 
Almost all restaurants “age” fugu for umami boost. It will lose the fugu’s fresh texture as well as if they use affordable farmed ones, it will have a little unpleasant aftertaste (because of the feed.) 
If you eat one of these for the first time, you’ll feel like “I tried it once out of curiosity, but this is enough for me.” Even some places( actually many) cure Fugu with msg. - these Fugu sashimi is simply the same as other dead white fish sashimi. 

However, the real wild fresh or properly few days aged Fugu has very unique texture and elegant taste, which I think everyone will admire it for sure. Because Fugu is a high activity white fish and eats anything, the muscle and gelatin is full of gorgeous flavor. Sliced thin and eaten with ponzu, or sea salt and daidai citrus juice, it is super delicious and very very unique experience. These experience costs at least $150 - 250 per a person. And still some places are fraud.",0
This was taken on our trip to Kyoto in the Gion district.,0
[removed],0
"Don't get me wrong, not trying to put it down, everyone has their preferences. Much like sujiko (salmon roe still in the egg sack), one of the most horrible things I've ever tasted, which is very rare for me to say. 

For me, it was basically like squid, a bit chewy and not much flavor, hence the need for ponzu. Honestly curious, since you are the first I've heard to really like it, how do you see it different from squid? Besides the numbing op mentioned that I didn't get. 

Didn't try the shirako, will try that next time I get back to Japan.",0
"Tonkatsu was made from pork end chops and cooked in a deep fryer for 4 minutes at 350F. Served with freshly ground sesame seeds and Bulldog tonkatsu sauce.

Sesame dressing was based on [the recipe at Just One Cookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/sesame-dressing/).",0
"I think it’s really that good. I just wanted to present the opinion that someone can like fugu for a reason OTHER than the thrill element. I think it’s fantastic!

It has mild flavors but has great texture and is fantastic with ponzu. The shirako from fugu is awesome as well.",0
looks delicious !,0
"Tonkatsu is one of my favourite japanese dishes! If you wanna vary, you can use chicken instead, that variant is called ""torikatsu""!",0
Ill stick with Hamachi toro for now. Thanks!,0
"It is a unique experience, 1 of those things to try once for sure. 

Interesting, never had any numbing the couple times I've had it. Wonder if that's just me or the chefs.",0
Testicles of fugu,0
"It's more the experience, the bit of numbing sensation to remind you it could kill you.  

We had fugu with a friend in Tokyo, friend had a known shellfish allergy.  One fish prepared for us 3 ways, with as much sashimi as shown. Whereas our lips and tongue went numb during the dining experience, her whole face went numb.  She was freaked right out.",0

When you eat it, you put the entire thing in your mouth and pull on the end to get the beans out and suck it so that  you get all of that good flavor!",0

"That is the form of miso most people use to make miso soup. You can just add boiling water, but adding some mushrooms, tofu, or green onions will make it better. Instant soup is for when you are extra lazy, like microwave dinners.

"Sorry if the question sounds dumb, I don't know a thing about this.

So I've become more and more interested in Japanese food and culture, and I've never been to Japan (I live in Iran) and there's no Japanese store in Iran (because of Sanctions and many other reasons)... so I asked my friend, who recently traveled to Italy, to buy me some Japanese products like Mochi, Ramen Noodles, and Miso Soup (ready-to-eat soups that only need you to add it to boiling water).

But my friend (who didn't know about these things) bought this instead. What the hell is this thing? Can I make a miso soup out of it? Or is it only to be served in Salads and Sauces as it says on the label?

I'd appreciate it if you could help me here. I don't want to throw it away :) seems like a new, unique taste I've never tried.

Baked tofu is easy to make if you have a [gas torch](https://www.amazon.com/iwatani-cassette-burner-cooking-cb-tc-cpro2/dp/b00atut8cc), as all you need to do is sear the surface of the tofu. It's good to have if you like cooking as it can be used to abri salmon, melt cheese or sear crème brûlée.",0

Note that many places that sell tofu will also have yakidofu but I'm assuming you've already checked and you can only get normal tofu.  

The key point for making yakidofu is that you need to ""drain""/leech excess water out of the tofu before you char it.  There are three ways of doing this.  

Method 1 - Microwave  

Wrap the block of tofu in a paper towel, put it on a plate and microwave it uncovered for approx 2min at 600w.  After taking the tofu out of the oven, you can optionally let it rest/drain on top of a cooling rack to remove a bit more moisture.  This is by far the fastest method but you risk changing the texture of the tofu.  

Method 2 - Put something heavy on it  

Wrap the tofu in a paper towel, put it on a plate and place something relatively heavy on top for for up to approx 3hrs.  You can adjust the time (as little as 30min to an 1hr) and weight depending on how much water you want to remove.  For the weight, you might try a pot or large bowl full of water or a brick or two.  Heavy enough to press the tofu, not so heavy that it crushes it.  In either case, make sure that the weight rests safely on top of the tofu so that it doesn't fall off and onto your foot.   

Method 3 - Boiling    

Boil plenty of water in a large pot.  Carefully place the tofu into the pot and let it come back up to a boil.  Turn the heat to med-low and let it boil/simmer for 3-5 minutes.  Take the tofu out, wrap it in a paper towel and place on a cooling rack for about 15 minutes.   

Before you cut and char the tofu, wipe it down with another paper towel to get rid of the surface moisture.  Char using whatever method is most convenient: on a grill, using a kitchen torch/flame, in a frying pan with a tiny bit of oil at med to med-high heat etc.  The grill/flame can add some flavor but for most people, the frying pan method will be easiest.",0
"Its so versatile. Think chocolate cream, dulce de leche, strawberry jam and pb, ice cream, nut butters, biscoff, etc &lt;3 no I have not made them. I need to though ;-; taiyaki pan...I need you.",0

That looks delicious! Did you follow a recipe?,0

They definitely are!,0
Ok. Who do you want me to use my telekinetic powers against this time?,0
Interesting! I'll have to give it a try.,0
"So basically 1 large onion and 1 large carrot chopped, into a pan with a bit of oil, cook til the onion starts to brown. Then add 2 minced cloves of garlic, and the same amount of minced ginger, and fry that off for about 30secs. Then add about 1tbsp curry powder and like 1/2 tsp turmeric. Stir that in then add a can of coconut milk, a couple tsps of maple syrup (if youre not vegan honey is just fine) and a bit of water to help it cook. Simmer it for like 20-30 mins until the carrots are soft, then blend it til smooth. Season with whatever it needs, i found it came out a little too sweet so a bit of lime juice and salt worked well for it. I didn't actually measure anything before i started so if it comes out completely shit just look up how to make one😂",0
I think I read some people did die because of it and it's more common during New Years with older folk. Looks delicious though,0
You can also slice them to make faux scallops as their flavor/texture are somewhat similar. :),0
Interesting! What's your recipe?,0
Turmeric,0
YUM that looks incredible! Ikura is one of life's greatest pleasures,0
Why is your katsu sauce yellow?,0
God I love yaki mochi!,0
Oyster mushrooms are also not that hard to grow.,0
You can even put something like teriyaki chicken in onigiri. Or make yaki onigiri. You can also put something in them but there also good without.,0
Did you cook it only butter? I need to try that,0
[if any one is interested here’s how to do it! ](https://youtu.be/kgusnEZrwiQ),0
Posted on the above comment!,0
"I bought those dried blocks (or rather disks) of mochi, and grilled them on a non stick pan while brushing them with soy sauce and flipping them occasionally. It took roughly 10 minutes to cook, but you'll know when they're done by poking at them to feel if the inside is squishy. After, all you have to do is wrap it with nori or you can eat it as is :) It makes for a really simple but good snack!",0
I 100% approve of this idea,0
I ate them before I thought to take a pic of that sorry! However I can tell you they were stretchy to the point of almost being a choking hazard lol it was great,0

For the mushrooms i just sliced king oysters into lengthwise planks, dredged them in seasoned flour, then aquafaba (vegan egg substitute) then breadcrumbs. I didn't use panko but use panko if you have it, i would have. Then shallow fry in a medium-high pan filled with a few cm of oil, flipping once after about a minute, then seasoning with salt as soon as its out the oil. The rice is just a standard mushroom and egg fried rice with a bit of chilli oil, nothing special. Then the requisite chopped green onions obviously, and i ground some pink pepper over the sauce to make it look fancy but dont do that cos im just extra dont be like me",0
oh wow those mushrooms look so delicious! I'll have to try this!,0
That better not my hot mustard,0
I love king oysters! Man my wife is Vietnamese and makes a sugar soy sauce. Right now I’m thinking about doing something similar only marinating them in that sauce a good while before frying. Looks great!,0

Awesome! I would love the recipe if you’d be willing to share,0
"asian grocery markets. huge selection in Korean ones, but you can still find them in Japanese, Chinese, or Vietnamese.",0
they also freeze well and still have some bite when defrosted. they're amazing. definitely my top mushroom. shiitake is probably a close second.,0

Thank you so much!,0

"You can also do empty ones, so they're just the rice ball with some nori and maybe some furikake (seasoning) on the outside for flavour.",0
Thank you but we don't like mushrooms. Once my daughter is in school if she likes them it would be a good idea. Thank you.,0
Bonito flakes is a possibility once I can get to an Asian Market but mushrooms are out we don't like them. Thank you though and spicy Mayo may be an idea for my partner thank you.,0
You can put in some mushrooms or bonito flakes marinated in soy sauce. I hope you have a fun time making Onigiri as I recently made Onigiri for the first time as well. I'm not sure if you like spicy mayo but you should try it with your Onigiri it's reallly easy to make good luck.,0
You could try marinated mushrooms as well,0
"No I don't have an Asian market/shop near by unfortunately I have to travel 20+miles via public transport to get to one, and with lockdown thats impossible. Chicken Mayo sounds cool or chicken teriyaki. I will look into those. Thank you.",0
"Do you have an Asian market nearby to get ingredients? Umeboshi (pickled plum) is pretty standard, very strong flavor. I’d think any other sort of Japanese pickle such as takuan (pickled daikon). More broadly, this category of pickled vegetables (oshinko) generally pairs well with plain rice. 

You might also try ohitashi, which is blanched greens marinated in soy and dashi, generally served cold. Or goma-ae which is spinach in a sesame sauce. 

You can also use onigiri as a vessel for leftover meats, much like a sandwich in typical Western fare. Maybe some leftover gyudon or chicken teriyaki. Or you could go sort of Hawaiian and do some pan fried Spam or whatever tinned meat you have in the UK. Tuna/Mayo is common, but I bet it works as well with chicken/mayo.",0

"Sure! (Sorry I was away.) It's super easy once you get a bag of Rice Brun and the container to put the Rice Brun and vegs of your choice!  The pickled vegs are called ""Nuka Zuke"" (糠漬け).

I'm sure that if you go to a local Japanese/Asian store, you can find a bag of Rice Brun. Basically, you just put the vegs of your choice inside the bed of Rice Brun and leave it 1-2 days! Hope you enjoy! :D",0

"I’m currently using mung beans but I’ve had success with soy beans and adzuki. First, I soak dry beans in water overnight. I use a little plant pot I got especially for sprouts but I think you can reuse anything (yoghurt pots, empty glass jars etc) so I line the bottom with a recycled onion bag and a sheet of kitchen roll. Pour on the now soaked beans and spread into a flat layer (you can do multiple layers with a sheet of roll in between) and add another kitchen roll sheet on top. Soak everything with water and drain well. I water mine once everyday in the morning and they take around a week to be ready. It’s optional but you can add some extra weight to the top to make the sprouts grow thicker (I use water in a sandwich bag). When they’re ready, I wash in cool water to fish out as many bean casings as I can.",0

Unfortunately where I live the only bean sprouts my local sells is from the can. The recipe I follow tastes much better when they are fresh. Cooking times may very and you don't necessarily need to cook them further. It's all about how much crunch you want.

Curry-ya served me a bland watery thing with rubberized microwaved pork and I've never been back. Also, I asked if they could make it spicy, and they said no and gave me a thing of schichimi. While I love schichimi, it has no heat.

"Ebi Fry is a super popular home cooked meal here in Japan, but I’ve never been a big fan. After quite a bit of testing, I’ve come up with a method to make Ebi Fry that I actually like. It starts by how you clean and prep the shrimp. I also like to brine the shrimp with salt and baking soda, which not only neutralizes any shrimpiness, it also firms up the texture of the shrimp. Instead of doing the usual 3-step flour/egg/panko, I used a method of batter coating and then breading which creates a really nice crust that stays crisp long after the shrimp has cooled to room temperature, which makes this work really well for bento as well. If you want to know more, you can check out the [video here](https://youtu.be/syMFqGBP6ww).",0

"Yes, this is a challenge. They make ""cooking sake"" that avoids liquor taxes by making it undrinkable, but the problem is they make it undrinkable by adding salt. This makes any recipe too salty. I've seen some brands here in Japan release unsalted cooking sake, so it will be curious to see if they are able to export this abroad.",0
Problem with using sake or mirin (also goes for regular vine etc.) is that there alcohol that you can drink. So that's why you have to pay high tax here and that also makes them hard to find.,0

"Well of course lol, that’s the basis for whole dish. I assumed that was implied.",0
"Good question! The production of wheat, barley, buckwheat and amaranth date back pretty far in Japanese history (particularly in regions of Japan that weren't traditionally able to grow rice). I'd need to do more research, but I suspect rice was the dominant cereal because it was the easiest to grow and has a relatively high calorie density. As for potatoes, they weren't introduced to Japan until much later by the dutch and they came through Indonesia, which is why they are called Jagaimo (a mispronunciation of ""Java"" with ""imo"" which is used to refer to tubers).",0
Of course!,0
"Two different ingredients, two different uses. Yes, mirin does usually does have a higher glutamate content than sake, but Mirin is very sweet (45% sugar) and has a strong flavor that can over power more delicate dishes. 

Sake is also made with Koji. The difference is that mirin is usually made with whole grain rice (i.e. not polished), which means it has more protein for the proteolytic enzymes created by the Koji to break down. This in turn can create more umami. As for sake and umami, all sake some some amount of amino acids, some just have more than others. This is determined by the amount of protein in the rice which is usually determined by the polish ratio. The more the rice is polished the less protein it will have. That's why cheaper sake is generally better for cooking. I'm going to cover all of this in next week's episode in more detail.",0
Definitely yes! You can also use 2 spoons,0
"Try using it in dressings. If you have a ton, you may want to pit a bunch and throw them in a blender/food processor to turn into a paste, which makes it easier to use as a condiment. It works really well just mixed in with boiled/steamed veggies and and tossed together with a little bit of oil, you can also add things like Katsuobushi if you want some more umami.",0
It’s numbing spice hot pot soup base. I would say it probably does not taste like Doubanjiang :(,0

"Get some real mirin. It’s got the flavor from the koji boosted way above sake. 

Also not all sake is the same. Some have umami while others don’t. Similar to wine.",0
Did you ever wonder why rice is used so much in Japanese cuisine?,0
The real question is whether there's a raw egg mixed in the rice.,0
You are welcome. I'm reading the ingredient list now which is written in Japanese. It's produced in Taiwan and is also fermented beans based. I guess it's fairly similar to Doubanjiang.,0
"Good to know. I know that doubanjiang is Chinese, I just recognized the hiragana on the side of the bottle and only had that for reference as to what this might have been. Thank you!",0

"Thanks! It's good on rice, but it's also a super versatile ingredient. A good way to think about it is as a substitute for lemon juice or vinegar.",0
"This looks amazing, and thanks for the recipe! I love umeboshi with rice but I'm so excited to try this chicken.",0
Blueberry lavender dressing from a place in Osaka :),0
"Ever eaten an umeboshi before? They’re a mouth-puckeringly sour and salty pickle that’s usually eaten as a condiment for rice in Japan. This concentrated taste also makes it a fantastic ingredient for seasoning dressings, sauces, and soups. This dish is as simple as throwing some wings in a pot with umeboshi, mirin and konbu, and simmering them together for about 20 minutes before reducing the braising liquid and glazing the chicken. It’s one of those set it and forget it dishes that comes together with almost no effort, and the resulting wings are ridiculously tasty.

"Yes its just a kind of protein in the fish, got squeezed out as the muscle fibre tightens. No harm even if you eat them. 
On top of applying more gentle heat as how you exactly described, I found it helpful to submerge in brine for 20 mins can break down the muscle fibre, which reduces the contraction (less squeezing of the albumin). It also make the fillet more moist :)",0

"## INGREDIENTS (EXTREMELY SIMPLE!!)

* Boneless Salmon fillets with skin 2 pcs
* Water (Just enough to cover salmon) 
* Salt (1 tbsp of salt for every cup of water)
* 4 Ingredient Teriyaki Sauce (https://youtu.be/cI9-wij8Ivg​) -- \~60-80ml

## STEPS 

1. Wet brine the salmon for 20 mins
2. Pat dry with kitchen towel
3. Pan sear with skin facing down over medium heat. Turn when the skin is browned and crisp. Brown other 3 sides
4. Reserve when it reaches internal temperature of 125F
5. Heat Homemade Teriyaki Sauce over medium-low heat, till desired thickness
6. Turn off heat. Turn salmon in the pan to cover all sides with Teriyaki Sauce. Serve.",0

While consumption of squid ink is common enough in my culture, I don’t know if it does have an actual taste to it so the vanilla I’m tasting must be really because of the vanilla. The squid ink is most likely just for the novelty.

Anyway, the restaurant we went to specializes in fantastic top-quality meat, so much so that the boyfriend and I did not get to talk much during dinner.

Before you can order, they will show you a slip of paper that says that by staying, you understand that English is not their language. Luckily enough, our server, who was also the meat guy, was a very hospitable person who tried his best to communicate with us.

"Stunning pic!

Really enjoy crossover dishes that nicely blends different cultures together.",0
aww,0
"Thanks for watching!

I'm usually the same with just using water. Decided to mix things up a bit this time by adding stock to see if the flavor would be richer. Wasn't too noticeable to me, and I might skip it in the future for a simpler recipe.

As for the beef, 300F in the oven for around 2 hrs. Also my first time braising for the recipe as I use to just simmer the meat for about an hour on the stove to soften it. 

This step I'll keep for the future, as it was really nice to have tender bites of meat vs the tougher chunks I sometimes get if I opted to just simmer on the stove.",0

"Reminds me of that time I was walking through Kyoto, bought somekind of rice ball wrapped in bacon at a stand near a temple. It was cheap, so I took some, walk to the nearest park to eat and that thing blew my mind. Couldn't believe how good it tasted.",0
I guess depends on how good the ingredients you want. A lot of the cheaper ones have some additives :(,0
Interesting. Didnt know there is a Hawaiian link to it,0
Yes! Any Japanese recipe I’m searching for it’s 95% chance she’s got one!,0
"Sure!

Meatballs:
- 350g ground chicken
- half onion (chopped finely)
- 60g corn or potato starch
- 1 egg yolk
- 1tsp grated ginger
- pinch of salt

Sauce:
- 45ml water
- 30ml mirin
- 30ml soy sauce
- 15g sugar

Mix all the meatball ingredients in a bowl. (It will be very sticky). Divide the mixture into 16 round balls and flatten slightly into ovals.

Mix all the sauce ingredients in a bowl.

Heat 1tbsp oil in a frying pan on medium heat and fry meatballs for 5mins each side. Then add the sauce and cook for another minute, whilst coating the meatballs with the sauce.

Serve immediately, covering left over sauce from plan over meatballs and sprinkle them with sesame seeds.",0

"The Japanese proverb “hana yori dango” is a reminder that simple, straightforward pleasures are often the best things in life. Literally, the phrase translates as “dumplings over flowers,” implying that while it’s all nice and good to gaze upon flowers and appreciate their beauty, it’s even better to have a dango (dumpling) to munch on.

But as sakura season approaches, maybe we should make a slight alteration to hana yori dango, and instead say “hana yori tacos.”

To celebrate the arrival of the cherry blossoms, Tokyo restaurant Taco Fanatico is adding Sakura Tacos to its menu. The pink soft tortilla calls to mind the color of Japan’s favorite flower, and a sakura tree leaf (yes, it’s edible) is wrapped around the taco as a further sign of spring.

This is actually a dessert taco, and you won’t find beef, fish, or other savory fillings inside. Instead, there’s a dollop of sakura an sweet bean paste, ringed by matcha green tea tiramisu cream.

The inspiration for the Sakura Tacos may have come from Taco Fanatico’s location. The restaurant is in Tokyo’s Nakameguro neighborhood, right next to the Megurogawa River, which is lined with cherry blossom trees in this section. The district has become one of Tokyo’s most popular and fashionable hanami (cherry blossom-viewing) spots in recent years, with local restaurants selling their fare to-go for visitors to munch on while looking up at the flowers.",0

"Another reason is that “teriyaki sauce” is really from Hawaiian fusion, sweet and thickened with starch. Japanese teriyaki is a grilling/sautéing technique, rather than a sauce per se.",0
"For those asking for a recipe, I think the key to these is the tangzhong and milk/milk-powder content.  Both add to overall water absorption and make for the super-soft texture typical of a shokupan.  

I can post bakers-% for this if needed, but this is a link I first referenced years back that does a good job explaining the details, as well as providing recipe measures.  All credit for this link goes to the author, Anita:

[https://dessertfirstgirl.com/2015/02/hokkaido-milk-bread-tangzhong.html](https://dessertfirstgirl.com/2015/02/hokkaido-milk-bread-tangzhong.html)

I do something very similar but with a bit less added sugar (there is already lactose sugar content within whole milk).  

Pay attention to temperatures for both the tangzhong and the dough during ferment, and allow extra bench time due to higher dough pH from the added milk.",0
Because it's **much** cheaper than sake and mirin... At least in my country :),0

"A gō isn't really the same thing of a ""cup"". Gō are only really used to measure rice or sake. You won't normally find Japanese recipes that use gō / ""cups"". mL and g is the standard for recipes in Japan (although, there is a Japanese version of a ""tablespoon"" 大さじ and ""teaspoon"" 小さじ, but they are just shorthand for 15 mL and 5 mL).",0

I'm an amateur myself and have a lot to learn. It's soo much fun. I love cooking and it actually was anime that brought me to look into Japanese cooking further. It all started with loving good sushi and trying takoyaki at a food festival,0
"Very true, if you can make a meal that looks and tastes good it can really wow your guests! I’ve just gotten into Japanese cooking very recently and hopefully by the time there can be visitors again I’ll be able to make a variety of dishes!",0

"Gotcha! We have a 1-6 dial so I will try it on 3-4 I guess. Thank you so much, talking about this is fun!",0
"Yeah, we have an electric stove and I had it at about a 6 heat (on a 1-10 dial) and it worked well. I will say I had some issues with them sticking towards the end, so about 1/3 of my prepared gyoza tore on the bottom, so be wary of that",0
"I have to try your method, it sounds amazing as well. I guess you would use medium heat for frying them?",0
"Ohh gotcha, yeah I did the whole process in a large pan!",0
It looks really good. The only suggestion I'd make is to stir your veg less while cooking it before you add the noodles. The best yakisoba has a bit of sear on the veggies (and especially the mushrooms) and you won't get that if you move them too much.,0
"Ah, you did them in a pan! We did use our rice cooker with the little steamer basket and parchment paper to steam them",0
That looks so good!,0
You’re gyoza look excellent. It’s hard to find them with such nice thin exteriors even in some restaurants round here. Nothing worse than when they are thick and doughy.,0
"ah, that's what I figured but if you had made the miso i was curious how it came out",0
"Oh my, those gyoza! They are looking stunning! Question from a fellow amateur, mine had a really hard rim but where nice and soft at the filling part. Did they go for too long?",0

I mostly followed the recipe and instructions here: [https://thejapanstore.jp/blogs/column/make-koso-genmai](https://thejapanstore.jp/blogs/column/make-koso-genmai)

The fragrance, texture, and color all change over the course of the cooking process. I used a regular rice cooker on keep warm setting and it maintained 60-70C. A little water added when stirring helped to keep the bottom and sides from getting dried out and crispy.

The taste and texture turned out great. The aroma at first is a lot like natto, and on researching the name in Japanese I have to think this method is intentionally making use of Bacillus subtilis.",0
"Japanese home cooking is a great cookbook! Especially if you don't have access to some specialty Japanese ingredients, bc she explains how to make a lot of things that you would normally buy.",0

"What recipe and amounts did you use for this? I've tried doing this in a Pullman pan before, but I've yet to find a recipe with the correct amounts.",0

That's why my recipe doesn't include mirin. I only mentioned it here because someone asked for it.,0

Looks really good and the photography is awesome,0

Niceeee,0
"Beef yakisoba is the spaghetti bolognese of Japanese food. Always reliable, and a good launching point for other Japanese dishes!",0
I'll second that! Those buns look mouth watering!,0
We’re gonna need a recipe for those curry buns. The internet demands it.,0
Yummy 🤤,0
These look delicious! I hope you enjoyed them.,0

"Ingredients: rice miso, sugar, mirin (rice wine), soy sauce, fish broth, rice flour, sesame oil, kelp broth

You don't use it for soup like pure miso, but as dipping sauce for dishes like tonkatsu, grilled fish, chicken, eggplant, oden or other meat or vegetable dishes. [Like this](https://www.justonecookbook.com/nagoya-miso-katsu/).",0
"It's a miso sauce, where the miso has aged for 10 years. Also has sugar, mirin, konbu and bonito stock, soy sauce in it. And more.",0
What’s the thing you’re heating the pot with?,0
"Can any one help me with what this is? I know it’s an aged miso product that my folks picked up for me at the factory in Japan, but I don’t know anything else. It’s not like any miso paste I’ve ever used.",0
Good luck finding true mirin anywhere outside of Japan or spending $$ online. It’s not hard to make though if you can make or buy koji.,0
"Hello kitty attraction park 
I absolutely loved this place",0
I've never thought to put eggs in shabu shabu. I can't wait to try it,0

"yeah its easier

Tonkotsu flavour?,0
Nice! The meal that keeps on giving!,0
"Honestly, we took our time and basically snacked for a couple hours, it didn't feel like a ton of food. We have so much left over, too, we're doing it again tonight!",0
These communal style meals with friends are one of the things I've missed most during the pandemic. Looks lovely! I'm assuming the food coma continues for a few days! Haha.,0
Thank you for your help.,0
"For shabu shabu, those two will be perfect in terms of flavor.  It’ll also take on the flavors of everything cooked in it as the meal goes on.",0
Thank you! It all looks really good!,0
"5 minutes, then cooled off to the side and peeled. Worked great!",0
How long do you leave the egg in?,0
We made a sesame dipping sauce and a soy chili garlic sauce.,0
Looks fantastic! Do you use Shabu Shabu dipping sauce?,0
Correct. We also soaked some kombu seaweed in the broth first.,0
"Amazon, just search for coco ichibanya and it will pop right up.",0
Just search for coco ichibanya and it will pop right up.,0
Basmati reheated until some of it was crispy.,0
Looks like basmati,0
Pretty nice cut of meat!! No fat to be guilty about,0
Thanks. Does that seem like enough flavor? Just those two? Cause I have both LOL!,0
"From the photo, top left has dashi bouillon powder and  better than bouillon roasted beef so I’m guessing it a mix of the two.",0
"Great guess, but no. Somehow it is listed in the ingredients list on Amazon on this product page:  


[https://www.amazon.com/Vermont-Curry-4-4oz-Bundle-3-pack/dp/B00JKRDFRE](https://www.amazon.com/Vermont-Curry-4-4oz-Bundle-3-pack/dp/B00JKRDFRE)  


But other Vermont Curry product pages does not list peanut. That's why I am confused, and there is no contact information anywhere for House Foods.",0
"In case you want to read a bit more and see some more pictures of this bowl and the shop, I posted some stuff [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLRlH34D9un/?igshid=1u2nx1mcm08uo)",0
